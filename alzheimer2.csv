10177,"High long-term test-retest reliability for extrastriatal 11C-raclopride binding in healthy older adults.","In vivo dopamine D2-receptor availability is frequently assessed with 11C-raclopride and positron emission tomography. Due to low signal-to-noise ratios for 11C-raclopride in areas with low D2 receptor densities, the ligand has been considered unreliable for measurements outside the dopamine-dense striatum. Intriguingly, recent studies show that extrastriatal 11C-raclopride binding potential (BPND) values are (i) reliably higher than in the cerebellum (where D2-receptor levels are negligible), (ii) correlate with behavior in the expected direction, and (iii) showed good test-retest reliability in a sample of younger adults. The present work demonstrates high seven-month test-retest reliability of striatal and extrastriatal 11C-raclopride BPND values in healthy, older adults (n = 27, age: 64-78 years). Mean 11C-raclopride BPND values were stable between test sessions in subcortical nuclei, and in frontal and temporal cortices (p > 0.05). Across all structures analyzed, intraclass correlation coefficients were high (0.85-0.96), absolute variability was low (mean: 4-8%), and coefficients of variance ranged between 9 and 25%. Furthermore, regional 11C-raclopride BPND values correlated with previously determined 18F-fallypride BPND values (ρ = 0.97 and 0.92 in correlations with and without striatal values, respectively, p < 0.01) and postmortem determined D2-receptor densities (including striatum: ρ = 0.92; p < 0.001; excluding striatum: ρ = 0.75; p = 0.067). These observations suggest that extrastriatal 11C-raclopride measurements represent a true D2 signal.","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism",31506011,18F-fallypride,"11C-raclopride measurements","dopamine-dense striatum",NULL,NULL

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of 18F-JK-PSMA-7 for PET/CT imaging of patients with prostate cancer. Methods: In an Institutional Review Board-approved pilot study, the initial clinical utility of PET/CT imaging with 18F-JK-PSMA-7 was directly compared with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in a group of 10 patients with prostate cancer. The 2 PSMA tracers were administered to each patient less than 3 wk apart. Next, we analyzed the data of 75 consecutive patients who had undergone clinical 18F-JK-PSMA-7 PET/CT imaging for tumor localization of biochemical recurrence (BCR). Results: The pilot study in 10 patients who were examined with both PSMA tracers demonstrated that 18F-JK-PSMA-7 was at least equivalent to 68Ga-PSMA-11. All unequivocally 68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesions could be also detected using 18F-JK-PSMA-7, and in 4 patients additional suspected PSMA-positive lesions were identified (1 patient changed from PSMA-negative to PSMA-positive). In patients with BCR (after prostatectomy or radiotherapy), the capacity of 18F-JK-PSMA-7 PET/CT to detect at least one PSMA-positive lesion was 84.8%. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-stratified detection rate of 18F-JK-PSMA-7 after prostatectomy varied among 54.5% (6/11 patients; PSA < 0.5 μg/L), 87.5% (14/16 patients; PSA 0.5-2 μg/L), and 90.9% (20/22 patients; PSA > 2 μg/L). Conclusion: The tracer 18F-JK-PSMA-7 was found to be safe and clinically useful. We demonstrated that 18F-JK-PSMA-7 was not inferior when directly compared with 68Ga-PSMA-11 in a pilot study but indeed identified additional PSMA-avid suspected lesions in oligometastasized patients with BCR. In a subsequent analysis of a clinical cohort of BCR patients, 18F-JK-PSMA-7 was useful in tumor localization. 18F-JK-PSMA-7 is recommended for future prospective trials.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31324713,18F-JK-PSMA-7,"68Ga-PSMA-11-positive lesions",BCR,NULL,PSMA-positive
70502,"Synthesis, radiolabelling and initial biological characterisation of 18F-labelled xanthine derivatives for PET imaging of Eph receptors.","Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly EphA2 and EphB4, represent promising candidates for molecular imaging due to their essential role in cancer progression and therapy resistance. Xanthine derivatives were identified to be potent Eph receptor inhibitors with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range (1-40 nm). These compounds occupy the hydrophobic pocket of the ATP-binding site in the kinase domain. Based on lead compound 1, we designed two fluorine-18-labelled receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors ([18F]2/3) as potential tracers for positron emission tomography (PET). Docking into the ATP-binding site allowed us to find the best position for radiolabelling. The replacement of the methyl group at the uracil residue ([18F]3) rather than the methyl group of the phenoxy moiety ([18F]2) by a fluoropropyl group was predicted to preserve the affinity of the lead compound 1. Herein, we point out a synthesis route to [18F]2 and [18F]3 and the respective tosylate precursors as well as a labelling procedure to insert fluorine-18. After radiolabelling, both radiotracers were obtained in approximately 5% radiochemical yield with high radiochemical purity (>98%) and a molar activity of >10 GBq μmol-1. In line with the docking studies, first cell experiments revealed specific, time-dependent binding and uptake of [18F]3 to EphA2 and EphB4-overexpressing A375 human melanoma cells, whereas [18F]2 did not accumulate at these cells. Since both tracers [18F]3 and [18F]2 are stable in rat blood, the novel radiotracers might be suitable for in vivo molecular imaging of Eph receptors with PET.","Organic & biomolecular chemistry",32253415,[18F]2,"fluorine-18-labelled receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors","Eph receptors","ATP-binding site","EphB4-overexpressing A375 human melanoma cells"
13674,"In vivo mitochondrial and glycolytic impairments in patients with Alzheimer disease.","OBJECTIVE
In vivo glycolysis-related glucose metabolism and electron transport chain-related mitochondrial activity may be different regionally in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). To test this hypothesis regarding AD pathophysiology, we measured the availability of mitochondrial complex-I (MC-I) with the novel PET probe [18F]2-tert- butyl-4-chloro-5-2H- pyridazin-3-one ([18F]BCPP-EF), which binds to MC-I, and compared [18F]BCPP-EF uptake with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake in the living AD brain.


METHODS
First, the total distribution volume (VT) of [18F]BCPP-EF from 10 normal controls (NCs) was quantified using arterial blood samples and then tested to observe whether VT could substitute for the standard uptake value relative to the global count (SUVRg). Eighteen NCs and 14 different NCs underwent PET with [18F]BCPP-EF or [18F]FDG, respectively. Second, 32 patients with AD were scanned semiquantitatively with double PET tracers. Interparticipant and intraparticipant comparisons of the levels of MC-I activity ([18F]BCPP-EF) and glucose metabolism ([18F]FDG) were performed.


RESULTS
The [18F]BCPP-EF VT was positively correlated with the [18F]BCPP-EF SUVRg, indicating that the use of the SUVRg was sufficient for semiquantitative evaluation. The [18F]BCPP-EF SUVRg, but not the [18F]FDG SUVRg, was significantly lower in the parahippocampus in patients with AD, highlighting the prominence of oxidative metabolic failure in the medial temporal cortex. Robust positive correlations between the [18F]BCPP-EF SUVRg and [18F]FDG SUVRg were observed in several brain regions, except the parahippocampus, in early-stage AD.

24762,"The Impact of Primary Tumor and Locoregional Metastatic Lymph Node SUVmax on Predicting Survival in Patients with Rectal Cancer.","Objectives
The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of the primary tumor and locoregional metastatic lymph node in predicting survival in patients with the preoperative rectal adenocarcinoma.


Methods
One hundred and fifteen patients [mean age ± standard deviation (SD): 58.7±11.4 years] with biopsy-proven rectal adenocarcinoma underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging for the staging were included in this study. All patients were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months (mean ± SD: 29.7±13.5 months). Tumor-node-metastasis 2017 clinical staging, SUVmax of the primary rectal tumor and locoregional lymph nodes on the PET/CT studies were evaluated.


Results
All patients had increased FDG activity of the primary tumor. The mean ± SD SUVmax of the primary tumor and locoregional metastatic lymph node were 21.0±9.1 and 4.6±2.8, respectively. Primary tumor SUVmax did not have an effect on predicting survival (p=0.525) however locoregional metastatic lymph node SUVmax had an effect (p<0.05) on predicting survival. Clinical stage of the disease was a factor predicting survival (p<0.001).


Conclusion
18F-FDG PET/CT is an effective imaging modality for detecting primary tumors and metastases in rectal adenocarcinoma and clinical stage assessment with PET/CT had an effect on predicting survival. Furthermore, in our study locoregional lymph node SUVmax was defined as a factor in predicting survival.","Molecular imaging and radionuclide therapy",32368877,18F-FDG,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)",p<0.05,NULL,NULL
41266,"Is 18F-FDG PET/CT useful for diagnosing relapsing polychondritis with airway involvement and monitoring response to steroid-based therapy?","BACKGROUND
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is a promising tool for diagnosing relapsing polychondritis (RP). However, its usefulness in assessing RP with airway involvement is unknown.


OBJECTIVE
This study aimed to further evaluate and confirm the potency of 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosing RP with airway involvement and monitoring response to steroid-based therapy.


METHODS
A total of 30 patients from a dedicated respiratory centre, diagnosed with RP in accordance with McAdam, Damiani or Levine criteria, were included in this study. All patients underwent baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT, and 10 patients underwent second scans after 2.5-15 months of steroid-based therapy. Visual scores (VS) and maximal standard uptake values (SUVmax) were analysed.


RESULTS
In the initial scan, 83.3% (25/30) of patients were found to have FDG uptake in more than one cartilage. The median VS and SUVmax in the cartilages were 3 (range, 1-3) and 3.8 (range, 1.9-17.9), respectively. Positive rates for PET/CT-guided biopsy in nasal, auricular, and tracheal/bronchial cartilages were 100% (5/5), 88.9% (8/9), and 10.5% (2/19), respectively, but the positive biopsy rate in the auricular cartilage was 92.3% (12/13) even without PET/CT assessment. Based on biopsy-proven sites, the sensitivity of PET/CT was 55.6%, and the specificity was 5.3%. Compared with the baseline scan, the second scan showed much lower median VS (2 vs 3, respectively; p < 0.0001) and SUVmax (2.9 vs 3.8, respectively; p < 0.001). Of 10 patients who underwent second PET/CT, 8 had complete therapeutic response, while 2 had partial response.


CONCLUSION
18F-FDG PET/CT assists in identifying multiple cartilage involvement in RP, but it seems neither a sensitive nor specific modality in diagnosing RP with airway involvement. Moreover, PET/CT has limited utility in locating biopsy sites and monitoring therapeutic response to corticosteroids.","Arthritis research & therapy",31831053,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL
12428,"Potential Applications of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in the Evaluation of Salivary Gland Uptake Function: Preliminary Observations and Comparison with 99mTcO4 - Salivary Gland Scintigraphy.","Purpose
To preliminarily evaluate the feasibility and potential of using 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT in evaluating the function of salivary glands and lacrimal glands in comparison with 99mTc-pertechnetate (99mTcO4 -) salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS).


Methods
A retrospective study was performed in 15 patients with different degrees of xerostomia and suspected salivary gland dysfunction. Each patient underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT first and SGS the next day, and the findings of both scans were compared.


Results
The results of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and SGS were consistent in 12/15 patients (80%) and were inconsistent in the remaining patients (20%). For 5 (33.3%) of 15 patients, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT provided more information than did SGS. Additionally, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT corrected the misdiagnosis by SGS for 1 patient.


Conclusions
68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT is a potentially useful imaging tool for evaluating the function of salivary glands and lacrimal glands. 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT can be a promising supplement to SGS, and its clinical value deserves further study.","Contrast media & molecular imaging",32410918,68Ga-PSMA-11,"99mTcO4 -)",NULL,NULL,NULL
43171,"Imaging Early-Stage Metastases Using an 18F-Labeled VEGFR-1-Specific Single Chain VEGF Mutant.","PURPOSE
Metastatic breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. The 5-year survival rate for metastatic breast cancer has remained near 26.9 % for over a decade. The recruitment of hematopoietic stem cells with high expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1) has been implicated in early stages of metastasis formation. We propose the use of an 18F-labeled single-chain version of VEGF121, re-engineered to be selective for VEGFR-1 (scVR1), as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to non-invasively image early-stage metastases.


PROCEDURES
scVR1 was 18F-labeled via a biorthogonal click reaction between site-specifically trans-cyclooctene functionalized scVR1 and an Al18F labeled tetrazine-NODA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diiacetic acid). The [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 was purified using a PD10 column and subsequently analyzed on HPLC to determine radiochemical purity. Animal experiments were performed in 6-8-week-old female BALB/c mice bearing orthotopic primary 4T1 breast tumors or 4T1 metastatic lesions. The [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 tracer was administered via tail vein injection; PET imaging and ex vivo analysis was performed 2 h post-injection.


RESULTS
The [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 was prepared with a 98.2 ± 1.5 % radiochemical purity and an apparent molar activity of 7.5 ± 1.2 GBq/μmol. The specific binding of scVR1 to VEGFR-1 was confirmed via bead-based assay. The ex vivo biodistribution showed tumor uptake of 3.5 ± 0.5 % ID/g and was readily observable in PET images. Metastasis formation was detected with [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 tracer showing colocalization with bioluminescent imaging as well as ex vivo autoradiography and immunofluorescent staining of VEGFR-1.


CONCLUSIONS
The diagnostic capabilities of the [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 PET tracer was confirmed in both orthotopic and metastatic murine cancer models. These results support the potential use of [18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1 as a PET tracer that could image metastases, providing clinicians with an additional tool to assess a patient's need for adjuvant therapies.","Molecular imaging and biology",33156495,[18F]AlF-NODA-scVR1,"18F-labeled single-chain version of VEGF121",VEGFR-1,NULL,NULL

Herein, we evaluated the potential value of 18F-FPGLU for PET imaging of glioma in orthotopic glioma-bearing SD rats. A series of competitive inhibition experiments with various types of inhibitors were conducted with C6 cells to investigate the transport mechanism of 18F-FPGLU in glioma. Establishment of orthotopic rat C6 glioma-bearing SD rats models was confirmed by MRI. Then PET imaging of 18F-FPGLU was performed on the orthotopic C6 glioma-bearing SD rats and compared with that of 18F-FDG. After the rats sacrificed, the whole brain was collected and immunofluorescence staining of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) were processed. Na+-dependent system XAG- and Na+-independent system XC- are the mainly transporters of 18F-FPGLU in C6 cells. N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which is associated with the invasiveness and proliferation of glioma cells, is also involved in the uptake of 18F-FPGLU. High uptake and retention of 18F-FPGLU was observerd in orthotopic glioma with good visualization and the tumor/background ratio reached 2.35 at 60 min post-injection, which was significantly higher than that of 18F-FDG (1.72) in small-animal PET images. High expression of MMP-2 and GFAP was observed in the immunofluorescence staining of glioma xerography slices. 18F-FPGLU seems to be a better potential PET tracer than 18F-FDG for brain glioma imaging with good visualization and ability to assess the tumor activity.","Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",33285464,18F-FDG,"18F-labeling l-glutamate",GFAP,NULL,"C6 cells"

60223,"Targeting fibroblast activation protein (FAP): next generation PET radiotracers using squaramide coupled bifunctional DOTA and DATA5m chelators.","BACKGROUND
Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a proline selective serine protease that is overexpressed in tumor stroma and in lesions of many other diseases that are characterized by tissue remodeling. In 2014, a most potent FAP-inhibitor (referred to as UAMC1110) with low nanomolar FAP-affinity and high selectivity toward related enzymes such as prolyl oligopeptidase (PREP) and the dipeptidyl-peptidases (DPPs): DPP4, DPP8/9 and DPP2 were developed. This inhibitor has been adopted recently by other groups to create radiopharmaceuticals by coupling bifunctional chelator-linker systems. Here, we report squaric acid (SA) containing bifunctional DATA5m and DOTA chelators based on UAMC1110 as pharmacophor. The novel radiopharmaceuticals DOTA.SA.FAPi and DATA5m.SA.FAPi with their non-radioactive derivatives were characterized for in vitro inhibitory efficiency to FAP and PREP, respectively and radiochemical investigated with gallium-68. Further, first proof-of-concept in vivo animal study followed by ex vivo biodistribution were determined with [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi.


RESULTS
[68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi and [68Ga]Ga-DATA5m.SA.FAPi showed high complexation > 97% radiochemical yields after already 10 min and high stability over a period of 2 h. Affinity to FAP of DOTA.SA.FAPi and DATA5m.SA.FAPi and its natGa and natLu-labeled derivatives were excellent resulting in low nanomolar IC50 values of 0.7-1.4 nM. Additionally, all five compounds showed low affinity for the related protease PREP (high IC50 with 1.7-8.7 μM). First proof-of-principle in vivo PET-imaging animal studies of the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi precursor in a HT-29 human colorectal cancer xenograft mouse model indicated promising results with high accumulation in tumor (SUVmean of 0.75) and low background signal. Ex vivo biodistribution showed highest uptake in tumor (5.2%ID/g) at 60 min post injection with overall low uptake in healthy tissues.


CONCLUSION
In this work, novel PET radiotracers targeting fibroblast activation protein were synthesized and biochemically investigated. Critical substructures of the novel compounds are a squaramide linker unit derived from the basic motif of squaric acid, DOTA and DATA5m bifunctional chelators and a FAP-targeting moiety.

74492,"Influence on [18F]FDG uptake by cancer cells after anti-PD-1 therapy in an enforced-immune activated mouse tumor.","BACKGROUND
Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibody is an immune checkpoint inhibitor, and anti-PD-1 therapy improves the anti-tumor functions of T cells and affects tumor microenvironment. We previously reported that anti-PD-1 treatment affected tumor glycolysis by using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). That study showed that anti-PD-1 therapy in a mouse B16F10 melanoma model increased glucose metabolism in cancer cells at the point where anti-PD-1 therapy did not cause a significant inhibition of tumor growth. However, the B16F10 melanoma model is poorly immunogenic, so it is not clear how anti-PD-1 treatment affects glucose metabolism in highly immunogenic cancer models. In this study, we used a cyclic dinucleotide GMP-AMP (cGAMP)-injected B16F10 melanoma model to investigate the effect of anti-PD-1 therapy on [18F]FDG uptake in a highly immune activated tumor in mice.


RESULTS
To compare the cGAMP-injected B16F10 model with the B16F10 model, experiments were performed as described in our previous manuscript. [18F]FDG-PET was measured before treatment and 7 days after the start of treatment. In this study, [18F]FDG uptake in tumors in the cGAMP/anti-PD-1 combination group was lower than that in the anti-PD-1 treatment group tumors on day 7, as shown by PET and ex vivo validation. Flow-cytometry was performed to assess immune cell populations and glucose metabolism. Anti-PD-1 and/or cGAMP treatment increased the infiltration level of immune cells into tumors. The cGAMP/anti-PD-1 combination group had significantly lower levels of GLUT1high cells/hexokinase IIhigh cells in CD45- cancer cells compared with tumors in the anti-PD-1 treated group. These results suggested that if immune responses in tumors are higher than a certain level, glucose uptake in cancer cells is reduced depending on that level. Such a change of glucose uptake might be caused by the difference in infiltration or activation level of immune cells between the anti-PD-1 treated group and the cGAMP/anti-PD-1 combination group.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FDG uptake in cancer cells after anti-PD-1 treatment might be affected by the tumor immune microenvironment including immune cell infiltration, composition, and activation status.","EJNMMI research",32189078,[18F]FDG,"(cGAMP)-injected B16F10 melanoma model",anti-PD-1,NULL,"B16F10 melanoma model"

43940,"Preclinical evaluation of [18F]D3FSP, deuterated AV-45, for imaging of β-amyloid in the brain.","INTRODUCTION
Since the approval of three 18F labeled β-amyloid-targeting PET imaging agents, Amyvid (florbetapir f18, AV-45), Neuraceq (florbetaben f18, AV-1) and Vizamyl (flutemetamol f18, F-PIB), they have increasingly been employed to assist differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in patients with dementia. Also, they are frequently used in selecting patients participating drug trials aiming to reduce β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in the brain. The first approved tracer in this class was [18F]AV-45, which is metabolized rapidly in blood and some of its N-demethylated metabolites cross the blood brain barrier and resulted in lowering the image contrast. To improve metabolic stability of [18F]AV-45, we hypothesized that substituting N-CH3 with N-CD3 at the metabolically labile position, creating [18F]D3FSP, may reduce in vivo N-demethylation. We report the preclinical evaluation of [18F]D3FSP as an Aβ imaging agent.


METHODS
Preclinical pharmacology of [18F]D3FSP was evaluated using in vitro autoradiography and competitive binding assay. Biodistribution of [18F]D3FSP was evaluated in wild-type CD-1 mice. In vivo metabolism in mice and in vitro microsomal metabolism were analyzed by HPLC. Single dose acute toxicity of D3FSP was also performed in rats.


RESULTS
[18F]D3FSP showed high binding affinity to β-amyloid plaques (Ki = 3.44 ± 1.22 nM, a value similar as AV-45 (Ki = 4.02 ± 0.22 nM)), and displayed excellent β-amyloid binding in AD brain sections consistent with known Aβ regional distribution. After an iv injection it exhibited good initial brain uptake and fast washout in wild-type CD-1 mice. In vitro microsomal metabolism and in vivo metabolism in mice did not result in any significant differences between [18F]D3FSP and [18F]AV-45. No treatment-related mortality or any adverse effects were observed in single dose acute toxicity studies administered at hundred-folds of maximum human dose.


CONCLUSION
A new small molecule, [18F]D3FSP, was prepared and tested as an alternative to [18F]AV-45 to reduce N-demethylation in vivo. This strategy did not lead to better in vivo stability. However, [18F]D3FSP displayed very similar Aβ targeting property comparable to [18F]AV-45.

18F-FDG PET/CT has some limitations in the evaluation of multiple myeloma (MM). Since chemokine receptor-4 is overexpressed in MM, we perform a prospective cohort study to compare the performance of 68Ga-Pentixafor and 18F-FDG PET/CT in newly diagnosed MM.


METHODS
Thirty patients with newly diagnosed MM were recruited. All patients underwent 68Ga-Pentixafor and18F-FDG PET/CT within 1 week after enrollment. A positive PET/CT was defined as the presence of focal PET-positive lesions in bone marrow or diffuse bone marrow patterns (uptake > liver). Bone marrow uptake values in 68Ga-Pentixafor and18F-FDG PET/CT (total bone marrow glycolysis [TBmGFDG], total bone marrow uptake with 68Ga-Pentixafor [TBmUCXCR4], total bone marrow volume [TBmV], SUVmean, and SUVmax) were obtained by drawing total bone marrow volume of interest on PET/CT. The positive rates of the PET/CT scans were statistically compared, and the correlation between quantitative bone marrow uptake values and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and staging was analyzed.


RESULTS
68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT had a higher positive rate than 18F-FDG PET/CT in recruited patients (93.3 vs. 53.3%, p = 0.0005). In quantitative analysis, bone marrow uptake values in 68Ga-Pentixafor (TBmUCXCR4, SUVmax, and SUVmean) were positively correlated with end organ damage, staging, and laboratory biomarkers related to tumor burden including serum β2-microglobulin, serum free light chain, and 24-h urine light chain (p < 0.05). In 18F-FDG PET/CT, only the SUVmean of total bone marrow was positively correlated with serum free light chain and 24-h urine light chain (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT is promising in assessment of newly diagnosed MM.

After a percutaneous ablation of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), follow-up investigations to evaluate potential tumor recurrence are necessary. The aim of this study was to analyze whether a combined 18F-Fluordesoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) scan is cost-effective compared to a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) scan for detecting local tumor progression.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A decision model based on Markov simulations that estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was developed. Model input parameters were obtained from the recent literature. Deterministic sensitivity analysis of diagnostic parameters based on a Monte-Carlo simulation with 30,000 iterations was performed. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100,000/QALY.


RESULTS
In the base-case scenario, CE-CT resulted in total costs of $28,625.08 and an efficacy of 0.755 QALYs, whereas 18F-FDG PET/CT resulted in total costs of $29,239.97 with an efficacy of 0.767. Therefore, the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 18F-FDG PET/CT was $50,338.96 per QALY indicating cost-effectiveness based on the WTP threshold set above.

49712,"PET imaging of hepatocellular carcinoma with anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid in comparison with L-[S-methyl-11C]methionine.","PURPOSE
[11C]methionine ([11C]Met) was used for cancer imaging based on upregulated amino acid transport and protein synthesis in different tumor types. However, the short half-life of 11C decay limited further clinical development of [11C]Met. Synthetic amino acid analog anti-1-amino-3-[18F]fluoro-cyclobutyl-1-carboxylic acid ([18F]FCABC) was developed and FDA-approved for PET imaging of recurrent prostate cancer. This study investigated "repurposed" [18F]FACBC for PET imaging of primary liver cancer such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in comparison with [11C]Met.


METHODS
[11C]Met was synthesized in the lab, and [18F]FACBC was purchased from a commercial outlet. A clinically relevant animal model of spontaneously developed HCC in the woodchucks was used for PET imaging. Bioinformatics analysis was performed for the expression of amino acid transporters responsible for radiotracer uptake and validated by PCR. Dynamic PET scans of [11C]Met and [18F]FACBC were acquired within 1 week. Standardized uptake value (SUV) was calculated for regions of interest (ROIs) defined over HCC and a liver background region. H&E staining and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining were performed with harvested tissues post-imaging.


RESULTS
Higher expression of ACST2 and LAT1 was found in HCC than in the surrounding liver tissues. PCR validated this differential expression. [11C]Met and [18F]FACBC displayed some differences in their uptake and retention in HCC. Both peaked in HCC with an SUV of 3.5 after 10 min post-injection. Met maintained a plateaued contrast uptake in HCC to that in the liver while [18F]FCABC declined in HCC and liver after peak uptake. The pathological assessment revealed the liver tumor as moderately differentiated similar to the human HCC and proliferative.


CONCLUSION
Both [18F]FACBC and [11C]Met showed uptake in HCC through the use of a clinically relevant animal model of woodchuck HCC. The uptake and retention of [18F]FACBC and [11C]Met depend on their metabolism and also rely on the distribution of their principal amino acid transporters.","EJNMMI research",31119488,[11C]Met,[11C]Met.,LAT1,"liver background region",NULL

For that, we prepared, thoroughly characterized, and radiolabeled [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-pamidronic acid radiopharmaceutical, a 68Ga precursor for PET bone cancer imaging applications. The preparation of NODAGA-pamidronic acid was performed via the N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester strategy and was characterized using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MSn).

2-(4'- [11C]Methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole ([11C]-PiB), purportedly a specific imaging agent for cerebral amyloid-β plaques, is a specific, high affinity substrate for estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), an enzyme that regulates estrogen homeostasis.


OBJECTIVE
In this work, we use positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [11C]-PiB to assess the functional activity of SULT1E1 in the brain of moyamoya disease patients.


METHODS
Ten moyamoya subjects and five control patients were evaluated with [11C]-PiB PET and structural MRI scans. Additionally, a patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received [11C]-PiB PET scans before and after steroidal and immunomodulatory therapy. Parametric PET images were established to assess SULT1E1 distribution in the inflamed brain tissue.


RESULTS
Increased [11C]-PiB SRTM DVR in the thalamus, pons, corona radiata, and internal capsule of moyamoya cohort subjects was observed in comparison with controls (p ≤ 0.01). This was observed in patients without treatment, with collateralization, and also after radiation. The post-treatment [11C]-PiB PET scan in one RRMS patient also revealed substantially reduced subcortical brain inflammation. In validation studies, [11C]-PiB autoradiography signal in the peri-infarct area of the rat middle cerebral arterial occlusion stroke model was shown to correlate with SULT1E1 immunohistochemistry.


CONCLUSION
Strong [11C]-PiB PET signal associated with intracranial inflammation in the moyamoya syndrome cohort and a single RRMS patient appears consistent with functional imaging of SULT1E1 activity in the human brain. This preliminary work offers substantial and direct evidence that significant [11C]-PiB PET focal signals can be obtained from the living human brain with intracranial inflammation, signals not attributable to amyloid-β plaques.","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD",31884462,[11C]-PiB,"[11C]-PiB SRTM DVR","amyloid-β plaques",NULL,NULL
28989,"Examining Immunotherapy Response Using Multiple Radiotracers.","PURPOSE
Cancer immunotherapy has shown huge potential in the fight against cancer, but only a small proportion of patients respond successfully to treatment. Non-invasive methods to stratify responders from non-responders are critically important as immune therapies are often associated with immune-related side effects. Currently, conventional clinical imaging modalities do not provide a useful measure of immune therapy efficacy. Sensitive imaging biomarkers that provide information about the tumoural microenvironment may provide useful insights allowing for improved patient management.


PROCEDURES
We have assessed the ability of a number of radiopharmaceuticals to non-invasively measure different aspects of the tumour microenvironment and correlated tumour uptake to immune therapy response in a syngeneic model of colon cancer, CT26-WT. Four radiopharmaceuticals, [18F]FDG (a glucose analogue), [18F]FEPPA (a marker for macrophage activation), [18F]FB-IL2 (a marker for CD25+ cells) and [68Ga] Ga-mNOTA-GZP (a marker for granzyme B, the serine protease downstream effector of cytotoxic T cells), were assessed as potential biomarkers to help stratify response to PD-1 monotherapy or combined anti-PD1 and CLTA4 therapy in vivo correlating tumour uptake with changes in tumour-associated immune cell populations.


RESULTS
[18F]FDG, [18F]FEPPA and [18F]FB-IL2 (a marker for CD25+ cells) showed limited ability to determine therapy response and showed little correlation to tumour-associated immune cell changes. However, [68Ga] Ga-mNOTA-GZP showed good predictive ability and correlated well with changes in tumour-associated T cells, especially CD8+ T cells.


CONCLUSIONS
[68Ga]Ga-mNOTA-GZP uptake correlates well with changes in CD8+ T cell populations supporting continued development of granzyme B-based imaging agents for stratification of response to immunotherapy.

Inflamed visceral adipose tissue (VAT) facilitates chronic inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions thereby leading to increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this study, we evaluated the glucose uptake of VAT and the carotid artery with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) and their association with CAD, including acute myocardial infarction (AMI).


METHODS
A total of 90 participants were enrolled (32 with AMI, 33 with chronic stable angina; CSA, and 25 control participants) and undertook 18F-FDG PET/CT. VAT glucose uptake was measured by using maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of VAT region. The target-to-background ratio (TBR) of carotid artery was defined as the SUVmax of carotid artery divided by the SUVmax of jugular vein. The SUVmax of spleen, bone-marrow (BM), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were used for the assessment of systemic inflammatory activity.


RESULTS

Hypoxia is important in the biology of glioma in humans. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with a hypoxia tracer offers a noninvasive method to differentiate individual tumor biology and potentially modify treatment for patients with malignancies. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypoxia, as measured by fluorine-18 fluoroerythronitroimidazole (18F-FETNIM) PET/CT, was associated with tumor grade, overall survival (OS), and immunohistochemical features related to hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, and the invasion of gliomas.


PROCEDURES
Twenty-five patients with gliomas in whom gross maximal resection could be safely attempted were analyzed. All patients underwent 18F-FETNIM PET/CT studies before surgery. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was obtained from the PET images of tumor tissues. Tumor specimens were stereotactically obtained for the immunohistochemical staining of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9).


RESULTS
A correlation between the SUVmax and glioma grade was found (r = 0.881, P < 0.001).

In cancer of unknown primary (CUP), positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with the glucose analog [18F]FDG represents the standard imaging approach for localization of the malignant primary. Frequently, however, [18F]FDG PET/CT cannot precisely distinguish between small occult tumors and chronic inflammation, especially in Waldeyer's tonsillar ring. To improve the accuracy for detecting primary tumors in the Waldeyer's tonsillar ring, the novel PET tracer [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-4 for specific imaging of fibroblast activation protein (FAP) expression was used as a more specific target for cancer imaging.


METHODS
Eight patients with suspicion of a malignant tumor in Waldeyer's tonsillar ring or a CUP syndrome were examined. PET/CT scans with [18F]-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-4 were performed for pre-operative tumor localization. After surgical resection, histopathological and immunohistochemical results were compared to PET/CT findings.


RESULTS
Histopathology revealed a palatine or lingual tonsil carcinoma in all patients. In case of lymph node metastases smaller than 7 mm in size, the [18F]FDG PET/CT detection rate of cervical lymph node metastases was higher than that of [68Ga]FAPI PET/CT, while both tracers identified the primary tumors in all eight cases. The size of the primary and the lymph node metastases was directly correlated to the respective FAP expression, as detected by immunohistochemistry. The mean SUVmax for the primary tumors was 21.29 ± 7.97 for 18F-FDG and 16.06 ± 6.29 for 68Ga-FAPI, respectively (p = 0.2). The mean SUVmax for the healthy contralateral tonsils was 8.38 ± 2.45 for [18F]FDG and 3.55 ± 0.47 for [68Ga]FAPI (p < 0.001). The SUVmax ratio of [68Ga]FAPI was significantly different from [18F] FDG (p = 0.03). Mean TBRmax for the [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-4 tracer was markedly higher in comparison to [18F]FDG (10.90 vs. 4.11).


CONCLUSION
Non-invasive imaging of FAP expression by [68Ga]FAPI PET/CT resulted in a better visual detection of the malignant primary in CUP, as compared to [18F]FDG imaging. However, the detection rate of lymph node metastases was inferior, presumably due to low FAP expression in small metastases. Nevertheless, by offering a detection method for primary tumors with the potential of lower false positive rates and thus avoiding biopsies, patients with CUP syndrome may benefit from [68Ga]FAPI PET/CT imaging.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",33057927,[68Ga]FAPI,"[18F] FDG","fibroblast activation protein",NULL,NULL

PSMA- and CD31-specific staining was conducted to visualize PSMA expression and neovascularization in tumor tissue ex vivo.


RESULTS
The triple-negative breast cancer cells MDA-MB231 showed a high pro-angiogenetic potential on tube formation of endothelial HUVEC cells. The induced endothelial expression of PSMA was efficiently addressed by radiolabeled PSMA-specific ligands. 177Lu-labeled PSMA-617 strongly impaired the vitality and angiogenic potential of HUVEC cells. In vivo, as visualized by μPET, radiolabeled PSMA-ligand accumulated specifically in the triple-negative breast cancer xenograft MDA-MB231 (T/B ratio of 43.3 ± 0.9), while no [68Ga]-PSMA-11 was detected in the estrogen-sensitive MCF-7 xenograft (T/B ratio of 1.1 ± 0.1). An ex vivo immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the localization of PSMA on MDA-MB231 xenograft-associated endothelial cells and also on TNBC cells.


CONCLUSIONS
Here we demonstrate PSMA as promising target for two-compartment endogenous radio-ligand therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.","Breast cancer research : BCR",31640747,[68Ga]-PSMA-11,"177Lu-labeled PSMA-617",PSMA,NULL,"MDA-MB231 xenograft-associated endothelial cells"

This meta-analysis assessed the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT for IE and its subtypes. Methods We searched Pubmed, Cochrane, and Embase from January 1980 to September 2019 for studies reporting both sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT for IE. Meta-Disc 1.4 was used to pool data for all cases of IE and its subgroups of native valve IE, prosthetic valve IE, and cardiac implantable electronic devices IE. Results We screened 2566 records from the search, assessed 52 full-text articles, and included 26 studies totaling 1358 patients (509 IE cases). Pooled sensitivity and specificity (95% CI, inconsistency I-square statistic) were 0.74 (0.70-0.77, 71.5%) and 0.88 (0.86-0.91, 78.5%) for all cases of endocarditis. Corresponding parameters for native valve IE were sensitivity 0.31 (0.21-0.41, 29.4%) and specificity 0.98 (0.95-0.99, 34.4%); for prosthetic valve IE: sensitivity 0.86 (0.81-0.89, 60.0%) and specificity 0.84 (0.79-0.88, 75.2%); and for cardiac implantable electronic devices IE: sensitivity 0.72 (0.61-0.81, 76.2%) and specificity 0.83 (0.75-0.89, 83.6%). Pooled sensitivities and specificities were higher for the 17 studies since 2015 than the 9 studies published before 2015. Conclusions 18F-FDG PET/CT had high specificity for all IE subtypes; however, sensitivity was markedly lower for native valve IE than prosthetic valve IE and cardiac implantable electronic devices IE. It is, therefore, a useful adjunct modality for assessing endocarditis, especially in the challenging scenarios of prosthetic valve IE and cardiac implantable electronic devices IE, with improving performance over time, related to advances in 18F-FDG PET/CT techniques.","Circulation.

However, currently, most integrin αvβ6-targeting radiotracers are based on linear peptides, which are quickly degraded in the serum by proteinases. Herein, we aimed to develop and assess a 68Ga-labeled integrin αvβ6-targeting cyclic peptide (68Ga-cycratide) for PET imaging of pancreatic cancer. Methods: 68Ga-cycratide was prepared, and its PET imaging profile was compared with that of the linear peptide (68Ga-linear-pep) in an integrin αvβ6-positive BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer mouse model. Five healthy volunteers (2 women and 3 men) underwent whole-body PET/CT imaging after injection of 68Ga-cycratide, and biodistribution and dosimetry were calculated. PET/CT imaging of 2 patients was performed to investigate the potential role of 68Ga-cycratide in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Results: 68Ga-cycratide exhibited significantly higher tumor uptake than did 68Ga-linear-pep in BxPC-3 tumor-bearing mice, owing-at least in part-to markedly improved in vivo stability. 68Ga-cycratide could sensitively detect the pancreatic cancer lesions in an orthotopic mouse model and was well tolerated in all healthy volunteers. Preliminary PET/CT imaging in patients with pancreatic cancer demonstrated that 68Ga-cycratide was comparable to 18F-FDG for diagnostic imaging and postsurgery tumor relapse monitoring. Conclusion: 68Ga-cycratide is an integrin αvβ6-specific PET radiotracer with favorable pharmacokinetics and a favorable dosimetry profile. 68Ga-cycratide is expected to provide an effective noninvasive PET strategy for pancreatic cancer lesion detection and therapy response monitoring.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",32086242,68Ga-cycratide,"68Ga-labeled integrin","integrin αvβ6-specific PET",NULL,"integrin αvβ6-positive BxPC-3 human pancreatic cancer mouse model"

55826,"Diagnostic efficiency of 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in patients with suspected tumour-induced osteomalacia.","OBJECTIVES
Currently, the main challenge in tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is the difficulty in locating culprit tumours for definitive diagnosis and surgical therapy. Herein, we retrospectively evaluate the efficiency of 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in the localisation and diagnosis of TIO, and compared with 18F-FDG.


METHODS
Twenty-four consecutive patients with hypophosphataemic osteomalacia (HO) and suspicion of TIO who were referred to our centre for 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT scanning were retrospectively reviewed. The images were evaluated qualitatively as well as semi-quantitatively, and imaging results were compared with the final diagnoses.


RESULTS
Among the total of 21 patients who were included in the final analyses, 17 were diagnosed with TIO, while four were proven to have other causes of HO. 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT produced positive results in 16 of the 17 patients with TIO, representing a sensitivity of 94.1%. Moreover, the 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT results were negative in 3 of the 4 patients without TIO, representing a specificity of 75.0%. The overall accuracy of 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT in locating the tumours responsible for TIO is 90.5%. In particular, 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT detected the culprit tumours in 4 out of 10 patients with negative results on previous 18F-FDG PET/CT and showed a significantly higher T/M ratio of tumours than 18F-FDG PET/CT in the same patients (n = 10; 4.76 ± 3.08 vs 1.95 ± 1.33, p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT is an accurate imaging modality in the localisation of tumours for TIO. It is superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT and may be useful in the differential diagnosis of HO.


KEY POINTS
• TIO should be considered a possible cause for patients diagnosed with HO, which usually needs to be differentiated from other aetiologies. • 68Ga-DOTANOC PET/CT is an accurate imaging modality in locating culprit tumours for TIO, superior to 18F-FDG PET/CT.","European radiology",33021702,68Ga-DOTANOC,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL
73932,"Diagnostic Performance of RO948 F 18 Tau Positron Emission Tomography in the Differentiation of Alzheimer Disease From Other Neurodegenerative Disorders.","Importance
The diagnostic performance of second-generation tau positron emission tomographic (PET) tracers is not yet known.


Objective
To examine the novel tau PET tracer RO948 F 18 ([18F]RO948) performance in discriminating Alzheimer disease (AD) from non-AD neurodegenerative disorders.


Design, Setting, and Participants
In this diagnostic study, 613 participants in the Swedish BioFINDER-2 study were consecutively enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study from September 4, 2017, to August 28, 2019. Participants included 257 cognitively unimpaired controls, 154 patients with mild cognitive impairment, 100 patients with AD dementia, and 102 with non-AD neurodegenerative disorders. Evaluation included a comparison of tau PET tracer [18F]RO948 with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid and a head-to-head comparison between [18F]RO948 and flortaucipir F 18 ([18F]flortaucipir) in patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA).


Exposures
[18F]RO948 (all patients) and [18F]flortaucipir (3 patients with svPPA) tau PET; MRI (hippocampal volume, composite temporal lobe cortical thickness, whole-brain cortical thickness) and cerebrospinal fluid measures (p-tau181 and amyloid Aβ42 and Aβ40 ratio[Aβ42/Aβ40], and Aβ42/p-tau181 ratio).


Main Outcomes and Measures
Standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) in 4 predefined regions of interest (ROIs) reflecting Braak staging scheme for tau pathology and encompass I-II (entorhinal cortex), III-IV (inferior/middle temporal, fusiform gyrus, parahippocampal cortex, and amygdala), I-IV, and V-VI (widespread neocortical areas), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values, and subtraction images between [18F]RO948 and [18F]flortaucipir.


Results
Diagnostic groups among the 613 participants included cognitively unimpaired (mean [SD] age, 65.8 [12.1] years; 117 men [46%]), mild cognitive impairment (age, 70.8 [8.3] years; 82 men [53%]), AD dementia (age, 73.5 [6.7] years; 57 men [57%]), and non-AD disorders (age, 70.5 [8.6] years; 41 men [40%]). Retention of [18F]RO948 was higher in AD dementia compared with all other diagnostic groups. [18F]RO948 could distinguish patients with AD dementia from individuals without cognitive impairment and those with non-AD disorders, and the highest AUC was obtained using the I-IV ROI (AUC = 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99 for AD vs no cognitive impairment and AUC = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99 for AD vs non-AD disorders), which outperformed MRI (highest AUC = 0.91 for AD vs no cognitive impairment using whole-brain thickness, and AUC = 0.80 for AD vs non-AD disorders using temporal lobe thickness) and cerebrospinal fluid measures (highest AUC = 0.94 for AD vs no cognitive impairment using Aβ42/p-tau181, and AUC = 0.93 for AD vs non-AD disorders using Aβ42/Aβ40). Generally, tau PET positivity using [18F]RO948 was observed only in Aβ-positive cases or in MAPT R406W mutation carriers. Retention of [18F]RO948 was not pronounced in patients with svPPA, and head-to-head comparison revealed lower temporal lobe uptake than with [18F]flortaucipir.


Conclusions and Relevance
In this study, elevated [18F]RO948 SUVRs were most often seen among Aβ-positive cases, which suggests that [18F]RO948 has high specificity for AD-type tau and highlights its potential as a diagnostic marker in the differential diagnosis of AD.","JAMA neurology",32391858,[18F]RO948,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

However, the short half-life of 68Ga (T1/2 68 min) creates problems with manufacture and delivery. 18F (T1/2 110 min) labeling would result in a more practical large scale production and a cold-kit formulation would improve the spontaneous availability. The NOTA-chelator ligand FAPI-74 can be labeled with both 18F-AlF (Aluminum-Fluoride) and 68Ga. Here we describe the in-vivo evaluation of 18F-FAPI-74 and a proof-of-mechanism of 68Ga-FAPI-74 labeled at ambient temperature. Methods: In ten patients with lung cancer PET-scans were acquired at 10 min, 1h and 3H after administration of 259±26 MBq 18F-FAPI-74. Physiological biodistribution and tumor uptake were semi-quantitatively evaluated based on SUV at each time-point. Absorbed doses were evaluated using OLINDA/EXM 1.1 and QDOSE dosimetry software with the dose calculator IDAC-Dose 2.1. Identical methods were used to evaluate one exam after injection of 263 MBq 68Ga-FAPI-74. Results: The highest contrast was achieved 1 h p.i. in primary tumors, lymph node and distant metastases with SUVmax >10, respectively. The effective dose per 100 MBq administered activity of 18F-FAPI-74 was 1.4±0.2 mSv and for 68Ga-FAPI-74 it was 1.6 mSv. Thus, the radiation burden of a diagnostic 18F-FAPI-74 PET-scan is even lower than that of PET-scans with 18F-FDG and other 18F-tracers; 68Ga-FAPI-74 is comparable to other 68Ga-ligands. FAPI-PET/CT supported target volume definition for guiding radiotherapy. Conclusion: High contrast and low radiation burden of FAPI-74 PET/CT favors multiple clinical applications. Centralized large-scale production of 18F-FAPI-74 or decentralized cold-kit labeling of 68Ga-FAPI-74 allows flexible routine use.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",32591493,68Ga-FAPI-74,"18F-FAPI-74 PET-scan",cold-kit,NULL,NULL
38863,"Regional [18F]flortaucipir PET is more closely associated with disease severity than CSF p-tau in Alzheimer's disease.","PURPOSE
In vivo Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers for tau pathology are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and [18F]flortaucipir positron emission tomography (PET). Our aim was to assess associations between CSF p-tau with [18F]flortaucipir PET and the associations of both tau biomarkers with cognition and atrophy.


METHODS
We included 78 amyloid positive cognitively impaired patients (clinical diagnoses mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 8) and AD dementia (n = 45) and 25 cognitively normal subjects with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) (40% amyloid-positive)). Dynamic 130 min [18F]flortaucipir PET scans were acquired to generate binding potential (BPND) images using receptor parametric mapping and standardized uptake values ratios of 80-100 min (SUVr80-100min) post injection. We obtained regional BPND and SUVr from entorhinal, limbic, and neocortical regions-of-interest (ROIs), closely aligning to the neuropathological tau staging schemes. Cognition was assessed using MMSE and composite scores of four cognitive domains, and atrophy was measured using gray matter volume covering the major brain lobes. First, we used linear regressions to investigate associations between CSF p-tau (independent variable) and tau PET (dependent variable). Second, we used linear regressions to investigate associations between CSF p-tau, tau PET (separate independent variables, model 1), and cognition (dependent variable). We then assessed the independent effects of CSF p-tau and tau PET on cognition by simultaneously adding the other tau biomarker as a predictor (model 2). Finally, we performed the same procedure for model 1 and 2, but replaced cognition with atrophy. Models were adjusted for age, sex, time lag between assessments, education (cognition only), and total intracranial volume (atrophy only).


RESULTS
Higher [18F]flortaucipir BPND was associated with higher CSF p-tau (range of standardized betas (sβ) across ROIs, 0.43-0.46; all p < 0.01). [18F]flortaucipir BPND was more strongly associated with cognition and atrophy than CSF p-tau. When [18F]flortaucipir BPND and CSF p-tau were entered simultaneously, [18F]flortaucipir BPND (range sβ = - 0.20 to - 0.57, all p < 0.05) was strongly associated with multiple cognitive domains and atrophy regions. SUVr showed comparable results to BPND.


CONCLUSION
Regional [18F]flortaucipir BPND correlated stronger with cognition and neurodegeneration than CSF p-tau, suggesting that tau PET more accurately reflects disease severity in AD.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32291510,[18F]flortaucipir,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Recently, 18F-labeled PSMA agents have become available. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the detection rate (DR) of 18F-labeled PSMA PET/CT in BRPCa to provide evidence-based data in this setting. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases through 23 April 2019 was performed. Pooled DR was calculated on a per-patient basis, with pooled proportion and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Furthermore, pooled DR of 18F-PSMA PET/CT using different cut-off values of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was obtained. Results: Six articles (645 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled DR of 18F-labeled PSMA PET/CT in BRPCa was 81% (95% CI: 71-88%). The pooled DR was 86% for PSA ≥ 0.5 ng/mL (95% CI: 78-93%) and 49% for PSA < 0.5 ng/mL (95% CI: 23-74%). Statistical heterogeneity was found. Conclusions: 18F-labeled PSMA PET/CT demonstrated a good DR in BRPCa.

Metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors (mGluR5) modulate synaptic transmission and may constitute an important therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by mediating the synaptotoxic action of amyloid-β oligomers. We utilized the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [18F]FPEB to investigate mGluR5 binding in early AD.


METHODS
Sixteen individuals with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild AD dementia who were positive for brain amyloid were compared to 15 cognitively normal (CN) participants who were negative for brain amyloid. Diagnostic groups were well balanced for age, sex, and education. Dynamic PET scans were acquired for 60 min, starting at 60 min after the initial administration of up to 185 MBq of [18F]FPEB using a bolus-plus-constant-infusion method (Kbol = 190 min). Equilibrium modeling with a cerebellum reference region was used to estimate [18F]FPEB binding (BPND) to mGluR5. Analyses were performed with and without corrections for gray matter atrophy and partial volume effects.


RESULTS
Linear mixed model analysis demonstrated a significant effect of group (p = 0.011) and the group × region interaction (p = 0.0049) on BPND. Post hoc comparisons revealed a significant reduction (43%) in mGluR5 binding in the hippocampus of AD (BPND = 0.76 ± 0.41) compared to CN (BPND = 1.34 ± 0.58, p = 0.003, unpaired t test) participants, and a nonsignificant trend for a reduction in a composite association cortical region in AD (BPND = 1.57 ± 0.25) compared to CN (BPND = 1.86 ± 0.63, p = 0.093) participants. Exploratory analyses suggested additional mGluR5 reductions in the entorhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus in the AD group. In the overall sample, hippocampal mGluR5 binding was associated with episodic memory scores and global function.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FPEB-PET revealed reductions in hippocampal mGluR5 binding in early AD.

60830,"Comparison of patient stratification by computed tomography radiomics and hypoxia positron emission tomography in head-and-neck cancer radiotherapy.","Background and purpose
Hypoxia Positron-Emission-Tomography (PET) as well as Computed Tomography (CT) radiomics have been shown to be prognostic for radiotherapy outcome. Here, we investigate the stratification potential of CT-radiomics in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and test if CT-radiomics is a surrogate predictor for hypoxia as identified by PET.


Materials and methods
Two independent cohorts of HNC patients were used for model development and validation, HN1 (n = 149) and HN2 (n = 47). The training set HN1 consisted of native planning CT data whereas for the validation cohort HN2 also hypoxia PET/CT data was acquired using [18F]-Fluoromisonidazole (FMISO). Machine learning algorithms including feature engineering and classifier selection were trained for two-year loco-regional control (LRC) to create optimal CT-radiomics signatures.Secondly, a pre-defined [18F]FMISO-PET tumour-to-muscle-ratio (TMRpeak ≥ 1.6) was used for LRC prediction. Comparison between risk groups identified by CT-radiomics or [18F]FMISO-PET was performed using area-under-the-curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis including log-rank test.


Results
The best performing CT-radiomics signature included two features with nearest-neighbour classification (AUC = 0.76 ± 0.09), whereas AUC was 0.59 for external validation. In contrast, [18F]FMISO TMRpeak reached an AUC of 0.66 in HN2. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the independent validation cohort HN2 did not confirm the prognostic value of CT-radiomics (p = 0.18), whereas for [18F]FMISO-PET significant differences were observed (p = 0.02).


Conclusions
No direct correlation of patient stratification using [18F]FMISO-PET or CT-radiomics was found in this study. Risk groups identified by CT-radiomics or hypoxia PET showed only poor overlap. Direct assessment of tumour hypoxia using PET seems to be more powerful to stratify HNC patients.","Physics and imaging in radiation oncology",33043157,[18F]FMISO-PET,"[18F]FMISO TMRpeak",HN1,NULL,NULL

Subclinical lymph node (LN) metastasis is associated with poor survival outcome in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCC), which alleges elective neck LN dissection. Preoperative detection of metastatic LNs may improve prognosis and proper management of OCC. We examined the clinical usefulness of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for the detection of occult neck LN metastasis in OCC patients in comparison with conventional CT/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.


METHODS
A total of 178 OCC patients with negative neck palpation findings were assessed prospectively with 18F-FDG PET/CT and CT/MR imaging. Histopathological analyses of neck dissection samples served as reference. Diagnostic values of 18F-FDG PET/CT versus CT/MR imaging were compared with the McNemar test and logistic regression with generalized estimating equations.


RESULTS
Forty-two patients (23.6%) had metastasis in 44 sides and 58 levels of the neck. The sensitivity for detection of occult metastasis was higher for 18F-FDG PET/CT than that for CT/MR imaging on a per-patient (69.1% vs 35.7%), per-side (70.5% vs 36.4%), and per-level (62.1% vs 29.3%) basis (all P ≤ 0.001). However, the specificity for metastatic detection was higher for CT/MR imaging than that for 18F-FDG PET/CT (all P < 0.005). 18F-FDG PET/CT improved detection of occult metastasis up to 33.4% in these patients compared to CT/MR imaging.


CONCLUSIONS
18F-FDG PET/CT can better detect occult neck metastasis than CT/MR imaging, which may potentially impact the clinical management of OCC patients.","Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology",31606761,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",MR,NULL,NULL
8936,"Expression of Cellular Receptors in the Ischemic Hemisphere of Mice with Increased Glucose Uptake.","Many previous studies have shown reduced glucose uptake in the ischemic brain. In contrast, in a permanent unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) mouse model, our pilot experiments using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) revealed that a subset of mice exhibited conspicuously high uptake of glucose in the ipsilateral hemisphere at 1 week post-occlusion (asymmetric group), whereas other mice showed symmetric uptake in both hemispheres (symmetric group). Thus, we aimed to understand the discrepancy between the two groups. Cerebral blood flow and histological/metabolic changes were analyzed using laser Doppler flowmetry and immunohistochemistry/Western blotting, respectively. Contrary to the increased glucose uptake observed in the ischemic cerebral hemisphere on FDG PET (p<0.001), cerebral blood flow tended to be lower in the asymmetric group than in the symmetric group (right to left ratio [%], 36.4±21.8 vs. 58.0±24.8, p=0.059). Neuronal death was observed only in the ischemic hemisphere of the asymmetric group. In contrast, astrocytes were more activated in the asymmetric group than in the symmetric group (p<0.05). Glucose transporter-1, and monocarboxylate transporter-1 were also upregulated in the asymmetric group, compared with the symmetric group (p<0.05, respectively). These results suggest that the increased FDG uptake was associated with relatively severe ischemia, and glucose transporter-1 upregulation and astrocyte activation. Glucose metabolism may thus be a compensatory mechanism in the moderately severe ischemic brain.","Experimental neurobiology",32122109,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose,"immunohistochemistry/Western blotting",p<0.05,"FDG PET",NULL

RESULTS
Image analysis was faster with FusionQuant [median time (IQR) 7:10 (6:40-8:20) minutes] compared with OsiriX [8:30 (8:00-10:10) minutes, p = .002]. Agreement of uptake measurements between programs was excellent, CCC = 0.972 (95% CI 0.949-0.995) for mean tissue-to-background ratio (TBRmean) and 0.981 (95% CI 0.965-0.997) for maximum tissue-to-background ratio (TBRmax). Mean noise decreased from 11.7% in the diastolic gate to 6.7% in motion-corrected images (p = .002); SNR increased from 25.41 to 41.13 (p = .0001).

For PET/MRI, the study demonstrated a sensitivity of 89%, specificity of 64%, positive predictive value of 85%, and negative predictive value of 70%; PET/CT had a sensitivity of 95%, specificity 47%, positive predictive value of 82%, and negative predictive value of 78%.


CONCLUSION
Both methods have a high yield in N-clinical staging with statistically insignificant differences. We assume PET/MRI to be the first-choice method in organ-targeted examinations, for pediatric patients and repeat examinations. In cases of MRI contraindication, PET/CT can be used with no impact on the quality of care.","In vivo (Athens, Greece)",32606177,2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose,18F-FDG-PET/MRI),NULL,NULL,NULL
41474,"Syntheses and Preliminary Evaluation of Dual Target PET Probe [18F]-NOTA-Gly3- E (2PEG4-RGD-WH701) for PET Imaging of Breast Cancer.","PURPOSE
Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor 1 (TNFR1) and integrin αvβ3 receptor are overexpressed in breast cancer. We hypothesized that a peptide ligand recognizing both receptors in a single receptor-binding probe would be advantageous. Here, we developed a novel 18F-labeled fusion peptide probe [18F]-NOTA-Gly3- E(2PEG4-RGD-WH701) targeting dual receptors (TNFR1 and αvβ3) and evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of this radioactive probe in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 xenograft models in mice.


METHODS
The NOTA-conjugated RGD-WH701 analog was radiolabeled with 18F using NOTA-AlF chelation method. We used two PEG4 molecules and Glutamic acid (Glu) to covalently link c(RGDyK) with WH701. Gly3 was also added to further improve the water solubility and pharmacokinetic properties of the probe. The expression of TNFR1 and Integrin αvβ3 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was detected by western blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining. The tumor-targeting characteristics of [18F]-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGDWH701) were assessed in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 xenografts.


RESULTS
HPLC analysis of the product NOTA-G3-E (2P4-RGD-WH701) revealed a purity >95%. The yield after attenuation correction was approximately 33.5%±2.8% (n=5), and the radiochemical purity was above 95%. The MDA-MB-231 tumor uptake of [18F]-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGD-WH701) was 1.14±0.14%ID/g, as measured by PET at 40min postinjection (p.i.). In comparison, the tumor uptake of [18F]-NOTA-RGD and [18F]- NOTA-WH701 in MDA-MB-231 xenografts was 0.96±0.13%ID/g and 0.93±0.28%ID/g, respectively. The MCF-7 tumor uptake of [18F]-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGD-WH701) was 1.22±0.11%ID/g, as measured by PET at 40min postinjection (p.i.). In comparison, the tumor uptake of [18F]-NOTA-RGD and [18F]-NOTA-WH701 in MCF-7 xenografts was 0.99±0.18%ID/g and 0.57±0.08%ID/g, respectively.


CONCLUSION
[18F]AlF-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGD-WH701) was successfully synthesized and labeled with 18F. The results from the microPET/CT and biodistribution studies of [18F]AlF-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGDWH701) showed that the tracer could specifically target TNFR1 and integrin αvβ3 receptors.","Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry",32329699,18F,[18F]AlF-NOTA-Gly3-E(2PEG4-RGDWH701),"integrin αvβ3 receptors",NULL,"MCF-7 xenografts"

63152,"Evaluation of an Automated Module Synthesis and a Sterile Cold Kit-Based Preparation of 68Ga-PSMA-11 in Patients with Prostate Cancer.","68Ga-labeled urea-based inhibitors of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), such as 68Ga-PSMA-11, are promising small molecules for targeting prostate cancer (PCa). Although this radiopharmaceutical was produced mostly by means of manual synthesis and automated synthesis modules, a sterile cold kit was recently introduced. The aim of our study was to evaluate the image quality of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (PSMA-PET) in a population of PCa patients after the injection of comparable activities of 68Ga-PSMA-11 obtained with the 2 different synthetic procedures. A secondary aim was to identify secondary factors that may have an impact on image quality and, thus, final interpretation. Methods: Two different groups of 100 consecutive PCa patients who underwent PSMA-PET were included in the study. The first group of patients was imaged with 68Ga-PSMA-11 obtained using synthesis modules, whereas the second group's tracer activity was synthesized using a sterile cold kit. All PET images were independently reviewed by 2 nuclear medicine diagnosticians with at least 2 y of experience in PSMA-based imaging and unaware of the patients' clinical history. The 2 reviewers independently rated the quality of each PSMA-PET scan using a 3-point Likert-type scale. In cases of discordance, the operators together reviewed the images and reached a consensus. Performance was evaluated on the basis of the expected biodistribution, lesion detection rate, and physiologic background uptake. Results: Overall, 104 of 200 (52%) PSMA-PET scans were positive for PCa-related findings. No significant differences in image quality between cold kits and synthesis modules were found (P = 0.13), although a higher proportion of images was rated as excellent by the observers for kits than for modules (45% vs. 34%). Furthermore, after image quality had been dichotomized as excellent or not excellent, multivariate regression analysis found several factors to be significantly associated with a not-excellent quality: an increase in patient age (+5 y: odds ratio [OR], 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.75), an increase in patient weight (+5 kg: OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.53-2.32), an increase in 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake time (+10 min: OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.96), and a decrease in injected activity (-10 MBq: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.07-1.52). Conclusion: No significant differences were identified between the 2 groups of patients undergoing PSMA-PET; therefore, we were not able to ascertain any significant influences of tracer production methodology on final scan quality. However, increased patient age, increased patient weight, decreased injected activity, and increased 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake time were significantly associated with an overall poorer image quality.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31601704,68Ga-PSMA-11,"68Ga-labeled urea-based inhibitors",PSMA,NULL,NULL
64344,"The Effect of Chirality on the Application of 5-[18F]Fluoro-Aminosuberic Acid ([18F]FASu) for Oxidative Stress Imaging.","PURPOSE
The cystine transporter, system xC-, plays a crucial role in sustaining redox homeostasis and is reported to be overexpressed in several cancer subtypes. 5-[18F]Fluoroaminosuberic acid ([18F]FASu) is a novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, which exhibits specific uptake via system xC-. [18F]FASu synthesis by the commonly used Kryptofix 2.2.2/K2CO3-facilitated fluorination method results in four diastereomers, as a result of 2 chiral centers at positions 2- and 5- of the tracer. We recently reported the synthesis of the optically pure 2S-[18F]FASu from chiral precursors. Our preliminary results indicated preferential uptake of the 2S-isomer by tumor cells compared to 2R-[18F]FASu. Few studies have investigated the biodistribution of chiral 18F-labeled amino acids. The aim of this study was to evaluate the imaging utility and biodistribution of the 5-position diastereomers as well as the racemic (2S,5R/S-) mixture in three different tumor models.


PROCEDURES
In vitro tracer uptake experiments and Western blotting were performed in breast cancer (MDA-MB-231), glioblastoma (U-87), and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines. PET imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in xenograft-bearing immunocompromised Rag2M female mice.


RESULTS
All three tracer conformations allowed for the visualization of tumor xenografts at 1 h (for U-87 and PC-3 tumors) or 2 h (in the case of MDA-MB-231 xenografts) post-injection, with the racemate (2S,5R/S-) displaying similar image contrast as compared to the 5- position diastereomers and the 2S,5S-[18F]FASu conformation exhibiting relatively higher contrast for imaging U-87 and PC-3 xenografts. Tumor uptake of the isomers was blocked by an excess of the non-radioactive standard, aminosuberic acid (ASu), confirming target specificity. All three isomers were excreted via the renal pathway. Biodistribution analyses showed that PC-3 tumors had the highest tracer uptake, and the accumulation (%ID/g) of the 2S,5R/S-, 2S,5S-, and 2S,5R- isomers was 9.19 ± 1.14, 8.00 ± 1.41, and 7.16 ± 2.13 at 1 h post-injection, respectively. This gave corresponding tumor-to-muscle ratios of 33.68 ± 9.52, 31.42 ± 4.54, and 25.33 ± 4.97, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that pure 2S-[18F]FASu can be used to noninvasively image system xC- in a variety of cancers, either as the racemic mixture (2S,5R/S-) or optically pure form. Furthermore, this work shows potential utility of [18F]FASu for detection of glioblastoma and prostate cancer.","Molecular imaging and biology",31792837,[18F]FASu,"18F-labeled amino acids",NULL,NULL,NULL
68754,"Head-to-head comparison of tau positron emission tomography tracers [18F]flortaucipir and [18F]RO948.","PURPOSE
[18F]flortaucipir binds to paired helical filament tau and accurately identifies tau in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, "off-target" binding interferes with the quantification of [18F]flortaucipir in several brain regions. Recently, other tau PET tracers have been developed. Here, we compare [18F]flortaucipir with the novel tau tracer [18F]RO948 head-to-head in vivo.


METHODS
We included 18 participants with AD, three with amyloid-β-positive amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and four healthy controls. All underwent [18F]flortaucipir (80-100 min) and [18F]RO948 (70-90) PET scans within approximately 1 month. Four study participants underwent 0-100-min dynamic scanning. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were created using an inferior cerebellar reference region.


RESULTS
Neocortical tracer retention was highly comparable using both SUVR and distribution volume ratio-1 values obtained from dynamic scans. However, [18F]RO948 retention was significantly higher in the entorhinal cortex and lower in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and choroid plexus compared with [18F]flortaucipir. Increased off-target binding was observed with age for both tracers. Several cases exhibited strong [18F]RO948 retention in the skull/meninges. This extra-cerebral signal, however, did not affect diagnostic accuracy and remained relatively unchanged when re-examining a subsample after 1 year. Kinetic modeling showed an increase in [18F]flortaucipir SUVR over the scanning interval, compared with a plateau for [18F]RO948.


CONCLUSION
[18F]RO948 and [18F]flortaucipir bound comparably in neocortical regions, but [18F]RO948 showed higher retention in the medial temporal lobe and lower intracerebral "off-target" binding. Time-dependent bias of SUVR estimates may prove less of a factor with [18F]RO948, compared with previous tau ligands.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31612245,[18F]RO948,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
7242,"Pheochromocytoma and Paraganglioma Patients With Poor Survival Often Show Brown Adipose Tissue Activation.","CONTEXT
Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas (PPGLs) are neuroendocrine tumors that can secrete norepinephrine (NE). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation is mediated through the action of NE on β-adrenoceptors (β-ARs). In some malignancies, BAT activation is associated with higher cancer activity.


OBJECTIVE
To study the relationship between BAT activation and PPGL clinical outcomes.


DESIGN
A retrospective case-control study that included 342 patients with PPGLs who underwent 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) imaging at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We excluded all patients with parasympathetic tumors and those who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT after PPGL resection. Scans of 205 patients were reviewed by 2 blinded nuclear medicine physicians; 16 patients had BAT activation on 18F-FDG PET/CT [7.80%; age 27.50 (15.00-45.50) years; 10 female/6 male; body mass index [BMI] 24.90 [19.60-25.35] kg/m2). From the remaining 189 patients, we selected 36 matched controls (age 34.4 [25.4-45.5] years; 21 female/15 male; BMI 25.0 [22.0-26.0] kg/m2).


PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE
Overall survival.


RESULTS
The presence of active BAT on 18F-FDG PET/CT was associated with decreased overall survival when compared with the control group (HRz 5.80; 95% CI, 1.05-32.05; P = 0.02). This association remained significant after adjusting for the SDHB mutation. Median plasma NE in the BAT group was higher than the control group [4.65 vs 0.55 times above the upper limit of normal; P < 0.01]. There was a significant association between higher plasma NE levels and mortality in PPGLs in both groups.


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that the detection of BAT activity in PPGL patients is associated with higher mortality. We suggest that BAT activation could either be reflecting or contributing to a state of increased host stress that may predict poor outcome in metastatic PPGL.","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism",31903484,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",BAT,SDHB,NULL
7325,"Direct prospective comparison of 18F-FDG PET and arterial spin labelling MR using simultaneous PET/MR in patients referred for diagnosis of dementia.","PURPOSE
18F-FDG PET is routinely used as an imaging marker in the early and differential diagnosis of dementing disorders and has incremental value over the clinical neurological and neuropsychological evaluation. Perfusion MR imaging by means of arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an alternative modality to indirectly measure neuronal functioning and could be used as complement measurement in a single MR session in the workup of dementia. Using simultaneous PET-MR, we performed a direct head-to-head comparison between enhanced multiplane tagging ASL (eASL) and 18F-FDG PET in a true clinical context of subjects referred for suspicion of neurodegenerative dementia.


METHODS
Twenty-seven patients underwent a 20-min 18F-FDG PET/MR and simultaneously acquired eASL on a GE Signa PET/MR. Data were compared with 30 screened age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Both integral eASL and 18F-FDG datasets were analysed visually by two readers unaware of the final clinical diagnosis, either in normal/abnormal classes, or full differential diagnosis (normal, Alzheimer type dementia [AD], dementia with Lewy Bodies [LBD], frontotemporal dementia [FTD] or other). Reader confidence was assessed with a rating scale (range 1-4). Data were also analysed semiquantitatively by VOI and voxel-based analyses.


RESULTS
The ground truth diagnosis for the patient group resulted in 14 patients with a neurodegenerative cognitive disorder (AD, FTD, LBD) and 13 patients with no arguments for an underlying neurodegenerative cause. Visual analysis resulted in equal specificity (0.70) for differentiating normal and abnormal cases between the two modalities, but in a higher sensitivity (0.93), confidence rating (0.64) and interobserver agreement for 18F-FDG PET compared with eASL. The same was true for assigning a specific differential diagnosis (sensitivity: and 0.39 for 18F-FDG PET and eASL, respectively). Semiquantitative analyses revealed prototypical patterns for AD and FTD, with both higher volumes of abnormality and intensity differences on 18F-FDG PET.


CONCLUSION
In a direct head-to-head comparison on a simultaneous GE Signa PET/MR, 18F-FDG PET performed better compared with ASL in terms of sensitivity and reader confidence, as well as volume and intensity of abnormalities. However, using pure semiquantitative analysis, similar diagnostic accuracy between the two modalities was obtained. Therefore, ASL may still serve as complement to neuroreceptor or protein deposition PET studies when a single simultaneous investigation is warranted.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31960098,18F-FDG,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
13175,"Fluorine-18 labeled poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 inhibitor as a potential alternative to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose positron emission tomography in oral cancer imaging.","OBJECTIVES
The evaluation of disease extent and post-therapy surveillance of head and neck cancer using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET is often complicated by physiological uptake in normal tissues of the head and neck region, especially after surgery or radiotherapy. However, irrespective of low positive predictive values, [18F]FDG PET remains the standard of care to stage the disease and monitor recurrences. Here, we report the preclinical use of a targeted poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 (PARP1) binding PET tracer, fluorine-18 labeled poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 inhibitor ([18F]PARPi), as a potential alternative with greater specificity.


METHODS
Using an orthotopic xenograft mouse model injected with either FaDu or Cal 27 (human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines) we performed PET/CT scans with the 2 tracers and compared the results. Gamma counts and autoradiography were also assessed and correlated with histology.


RESULTS
The average retained activity of [18F]PARPi across cell lines in tumor-bearing tongues was 0.9 ± 0.3%ID/g, 4.1 times higher than in control (0.2 ± 0.04%ID/g). Autoradiography and histology confirmed that the activity arose almost exclusively from the tumor areas, with a signal/normal tissue around a ratio of 42.9 ± 21.4. In vivo, [18F]PARPi-PET allowed delineation of tumor from healthy tissue (p < .005), whereas [18F]FDG failed to do so (p = .209).


CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE
We demonstrate that [18F]PARPi is more specific to tongue tumor tissue than [18F]FDG. [18F]PARPi PET allows for the straightforward delineation of oral cancer in mouse models, suggesting that clinical translation could result in improved imaging of head and neck cancer when compared to [18F]FDG.","Nuclear medicine and biology",32135475,[18F]FDG,"fluorine-18 labeled poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase1 inhibitor",PARP1,polymerase1,NULL

This study aimed to measure the global brain glucose metabolism of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using MIMneuro software based on the normal brain glucose metabolism database.


METHODS
In this cross-sectional study, 23 patients (11 males and 12 females, mean age 25.6 ± 10.1 years) with TLE who underwent 18F-labeled fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) were enrolled. 18F-FDG PET images were then imported into MIMneuro software, which can automatically analyze the differences in regional brain glucose metabolism between patients and a normal database, and the results of different brain regions were presented by values of Z-score.


RESULTS
In patients with TLE, 18F-FDG PET imaging showed that in addition to the presence of temporal lobe hypometabolism, there was hypometabolism in the ipsilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, insula, amygdala, temporal operculum, and bilateral cerebellar hemisphere, while hypermetabolism was found in the contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, parietal lobe, parietal lobule, angular gyrus, and precentral gyrus. There was no significant difference in brain areas between the left and the right temporal lobe seizures (P > 0.05).

We compared tumor [18F]-FAC PET images to [14C]-gemcitabine levels, established ex vivo, in three mouse models of pancreatic cancer. We further modified tumor gemcitabine levels with injectable hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) to test whether changes in gemcitabine would be tracked by [18F]-FAC. Methods: [18F]-FAC was synthesized at MSKCC as described previously. Three patient derived xenografts (PDX) models were grown in the flanks of NSG mice. Mice were given PEGPH20 or vehicle i.v. 24 hours prior to co-injection of [18F]-FAC and [14C]-gemcitabine. Animals were euthanized and imaged one hour after tracer administration. Tumor and muscle uptake of both [18F]-FAC and [14C]-gemcitabine were obtained ex vivo. The efficacy of PEPGPH20 was validated through staining with hyaluronic acid binding protein. Additionally, an organoid culture initiated from a KPC (Pdx-1 Cre LSL-Kras G12D LSL-p53 R172H) tumor, was used to generate orthotopically growing tumors in C57BL/6J mice, which were then serially transplanted. Animals were injected with PEGPH20 and 14C gemcitabine as described above to validate increased drug uptake by ex vivo assay. PET-MR images were obtained using a PET insert on a 7T Brucker MR scanner. Animals were imaged immediately before injection with PEGPH20, and again 24 hours later. Results: Tumor/muscle ratios of [14C]-gemcitabine and [18F]-FAC correlated well across all PDX models and treatments (R2 = 0.78). There was a significant increase in the tumor PET signal in PEGPH20 treated PDX animals which was matched in ex vivo counts for 2 out of 3 models. In KPC-derived tumors, PEGPH20 raised [14C]-gemcitabine levels (T/M 1.9 vs 2.4, control vs treated, P = 0.013). PET-MR [18F]-FAC images showed a 12% increase in tumor [18F]-FAC uptake following PEGPH20 treatment (P = 0.023). PEGPH20 treated animals uniformly displayed clear reductions in hyaluronic acid staining.

47595,"Early brainstem [18F]THK5351 uptake is linked to cortical hyper-excitability in healthy aging.","BACKGROUND
Neuronal hyper-excitability characterizes the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In animals, early misfolded tau and amyloid-beta (Aβ) protein accumulation, both central to AD neuropathology, promote cortical excitability and neuronal network dysfunction. In healthy humans, misfolded tau and Aβ aggregates are first detected, respectively, in the brainstem and frontomedial and temporobasal cortices, decades prior to the onset of AD cognitive symptoms. Whether cortical excitability is related to early brainstem tau, and its associated neuroinflammation, and cortical Aβ aggregations remains unknown.


METHODS
We probed frontal cortex excitability, using transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with electroencephalography, in a sample of 64 healthy late middle-aged individuals (50-69 y; 45 women). We assessed whole-brain [18F]THK5351 positron emission tomography (PET) uptake as a proxy measure of tau/neuroinflammation, and whole-brain Aβ burden with [18F]Flutemetamol or [18F]Florbetapir radiotracers.


RESULTS
We find that higher [18F]THK5351 uptake in a brainstem monoaminergic compartment is associated with increased cortical excitability (r = .29, p = .02). By contrast, [18F]THK5351 PET signal in the hippocampal formation, although strongly correlated with brainstem signal in whole-brain voxel-based quantification analyses (pFWE-corrected < .001), was not significantly associated with cortical excitability (r = .14, p = .25). Importantly, no significant association was found between early Aβ cortical deposits and cortical excitability (r = -.20, p = .11).


CONCLUSION
These findings reveal potential brain substrates for increased cortical excitability in preclinical AD and may constitute functional in vivo correlates of early brainstem tau accumulation and neuroinflammation in humans.

Earlier and more sensitive detection of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity may allow improved treatment strategies and increase long-term survival. Lipophilic cation PET tracers may be suitable for early detection of cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to evaluate an 18F-labeled lipophilic phosphonium cation, [1-(2-18F-fluoroethyl),1H[1,2,3]triazole-4-ethylene]triphenylphosphonium bromide (18F-MitoPhos), as a cardiac imaging agent, comparing it with leading PET and SPECT lipophilic cationic tracers before further assessing its potential for imaging cardiotoxicity in an acute doxorubicin model. Methods: Cardiac uptake and response to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential of 18F-MitoPhos and 99mTc-sestamibi were tested in isolated perfused rat hearts. Baseline pharmacokinetic profiles of 18F-MitoPhos and 18F-fluorobenzyltriphenylphosphonium and their response to acute doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity were assessed in rats in vivo (10, 15, or 20 mg of doxorubicin per kilogram, intravenously, 48 h beforehand). Results: Cardiac retention of 18F-MitoPhos was more than double that of 99mTc-sestamibi in isolated perfused rat hearts. A favorable biodistribution of 18F-MitoPhos in vivo was observed, with heart-to-tissue ratios of 304 ± 186, 11.2 ± 1.2, and 3.8 ± 0.6 for plasma, liver, and lung, respectively (60 min). A significant dose-dependent loss of cardiac retention of 18F-MitoPhos was observed on doxorubicin treatment, with average cardiac SUV from 30 to 60 min (mean ± SD) decreasing from 3.5 ± 0.5 (control) to 1.8 ± 0.1 (doxorubicin, 20 mg/kg). Other assessed biomarkers showed no alterations. Conclusion: 18F-MitoPhos showed pharmacokinetic parameters suitable for cardiac imaging. A significant dose response of cardiac uptake to doxorubicin treatment was observed before detectable biomarker alterations. 18F-MitoPhos is therefore a promising tracer for imaging chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of radiolabeled lipophilic cations being used for the PET imaging of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity and indicates the potential application of these compounds in this area.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31147403,18F-MitoPhos,"[1-(2-18F-fluoroethyl),1H[1,2,3]triazole-4-ethylene]triphenylphosphonium bromide",NULL,NULL,NULL

The timing, extent and distribution of cell death in tumors following treatment can give an indication of outcome. We describe here an 18F-labeled derivative of a phosphatidylserine-binding protein, the C2A domain of Synaptotagmin-I (C2Am), for imaging tumor cell death in vivo using PET.


METHODS
A one-pot, two-step automated synthesis of N-(5-[18F]fluoropentyl)maleimide (60 min synthesis time, > 98% radiochemical purity) has been developed, which was used to label the single cysteine residue in C2Am within 30 min at room temperature. Binding of 18F-C2Am to apoptotic and necrotic tumor cells was assessed in vitro, and also in vivo, by dynamic PET and biodistribution measurements in mice bearing human tumor xenografts treated with a TRAILR2 agonist or with conventional chemotherapy. C2Am detection of tumor cell death was validated by correlation of probe binding with histological markers of cell death in tumor sections obtained immediately after imaging.


RESULTS
18F-C2Am showed a favorable biodistribution profile, with predominantly renal clearance and minimal retention in spleen, liver, small intestine, bone and kidney, at 2 h following probe administration. 18F-C2Am generated tumor-to-muscle (T/m) ratios of 6.1 ± 2.1 and 10.7 ± 2.4 within 2 h of probe administration in colorectal and breast tumor models, respectively, following treatment with the TRAILR2 agonist. The levels of cell death (CC3 positivity) following treatment were 12.9-58.8% and 11.3-79.7% in the breast and colorectal xenografts, respectively. Overall, a 20% increase in CC3 positivity generated a one unit increase in the post/pre-treatment tumor contrast. Significant correlations were found between tracer uptake post-treatment, at 2 h post-probe administration, and histological markers of cell death (CC3: Pearson R = 0.733, P = 0.0005; TUNEL: Pearson R = 0.532, P = 0.023).


CONCLUSION
The rapid clearance of 18F-C2Am from the blood pool and low kidney retention allowed the spatial distribution of cell death in a tumor to be imaged during the course of therapy, providing a rapid assessment of tumor treatment response. 18F-C2Am has the potential to be used in the clinic to assess early treatment response in tumors.","EJNMMI research",33296043,18F-C2Am,"18F-labeled derivative","C2A domain",NULL,NULL

Methods: A racemic glutamate derivative, 18F-hGTS13, was evaluated in cell culture and animal tumor models. 18F-hGTS13 was separated into C5 epimers, and the corresponding 18F-hGTS13-isomer1 and 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 were evaluated in H460 tumor-bearing rats. Preliminary studies investigated the cellular uptake of 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 in multiple immune cell populations and states. Results: 18F-hGTS13 demonstrated excellent H460 tumor visualization with high tumor-to-background ratios, confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution studies. Tumor-associated radioactivity was significantly higher for 18F-hGTS13 (7.5 ± 0.9 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g, n = 3) than for 18F-FSPG (4.6 ± 0.7 %ID/g, n = 3, P = 0.01). 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 exhibited excellent H460 tumor visualization (6.3 ± 1.1 %ID/g, n = 3) and significantly reduced uptake in multiple immune cell populations relative to 18F-FSPG. 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 exhibited increased liver uptake relative to 18F-FSPG (4.6 ± 0.8 vs. 0.7 ± 0.01 %ID/g), limiting its application in hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusion: 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 is a new PET radiotracer for molecular imaging of xC - activity that may provide information on tumor oxidation states. 18F-hGTS13-isomer2 has potential for clinical translation for imaging cancers of the thorax because of the low background signal in healthy tissue.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31171595,18F-FSPG,(S)-4-(3-18F-fluoropropyl)-l-glutamate,NULL,NULL,NULL
56551,"18F-FDG PET/CT AS AN ASSESSMENT TOOL OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA SECONDARY TO NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE DEVELOPMENT IN EXPERIMENTAL MODEL.","BACKGROUND
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be the last step of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) evolution. Experimental models are crucial to elucidate the pathogenesis of HCC secondary to NAFLD. The 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) plays an important role in evaluating HCC development and progression.


OBJECTIVE
To standardize the imaging method of PET/CT with 18F-FDG as an evaluation tool of the experimental model of HCC secondary to NAFLD.


METHODS
Ten male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with choline-deficient high-fat diet and diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in the drinking water for 16 weeks and then received 1 mL of saline solution (0.9%) daily by gavage for three weeks. At the 16th and 19th weeks, abdominal ultrasonography (USG) was performed. 18F-FDG PET/CT images were obtained before the beginning of experiment (week 0) and at the end (week 19). Histological and immunohistochemically analysis were also performed.


RESULTS
The USG results showed a homogeneous group at the 16th week with an average of 4.6±2.74 nodules per animal. At the 19th week, PET/CT findings demonstrated an average of 8.5±3.7 nodules per animal. The mean values of SUVmed and SUVmax were 2.186±0.1698 and 3.8±1.74, respectively. The average number of nodules per animal in the histological analysis was 5.5±1.5. From all nodules, 4.6% were classified as well-differentiated HCC and 81.8% were classified as poorly-differentiated HCC.


CONCLUSION
18F-FDG PET/CT was able to evaluate the development of HCC in an experimental model of NAFLD non-invasively. From the standardization of PET/CT in this model, it is possible to use this tool in future studies to monitor, in vivo and non-invasively, the progression of HCC.","Arquivos de gastroenterologia",31141073,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL
59704,"Current application and future perspectives of prostate specific membrane antigen PET imaging in prostate cancer.","As precision medicine evolves, the contribution of molecular imaging to the management of prostate cancer (PCa) patients, especially for positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging, is gaining importance. Highly successful approaches to measure the expression of the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been introduced recently. PSMA, the glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is a membrane bound metallo-peptidase that is overexpressed in 90-100% of PCa cells. Due to its selective over-expression, PSMA is a reliable tissue marker for prostate cancer and is considered an ideal target for tumor specific imaging and therapy. A variety of PET and SPECT probes targeting this peptide receptor have been introduced. These are undergoing extensive clinical evaluations. Initial results attest to a high accuracy for disease detection compared conventional radiology (CT or MRI) and other nuclear medicine procedure (choline PET or fluciclovine PET). However, prospective evaluation of the impact on patient management for PSMA-ligand PET and its impact on patient outcome is currently missing. Finally, PSMA inhibitors can be radio-labeled with diagnostic (68Ga-PSMA-11), or therapeutic nuclides (177Lu/225Ac PSMA-617) to be used as theranostic agent. Initial results showed that PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy can potentially delay disease progression in metastatic castrate-resistant PCa. This review aims to explore the current application of PSMA based imaging in prostate cancer, reporting about main advantages and limitations of this new theranostic procedure. The future perspectives and potential the applications of this agent will be also discussed.","The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...",29521482,68Ga-PSMA-11,"radio-labeled with diagnostic",PSMA,NULL,NULL

To evaluate whether the sequential dual-time-point fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (DTP 18F-FDG PET/CT) study improves the differential diagnosis in the larynx.


Background
In some cases, the clinical and metabolic similarity of laryngitis and larynx cancer make differential diagnostics difficult when performing standard 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations; therefore, an additional study protocol performance seems to be of reasonable value.


Materials and methods
90 patients (mean age: 61 ± 11 years, range: 41-84 years): 23 women (mean age: 63 ± 10 years, range: 51-84 years) and 67 men (mean age: 61 ± 11 years, range: 41-80 years) underwent delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT examinations at 60 and 90 min post intravenous injection (p.i.) of the radiopharmaceutical 18F-FDG. We compared the metabolic activity of 90 structures divided into following groups: normal larynx (30 patients), laryngitis (30 lesions) and larynx cancer (30 tumors) with maximal and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax, SUVmean) and the retention index (RI-SUVmax). We used the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve to evaluate the SUVmax cut-off values.


Results
The SUVmax cut-off value at 60 and 90 min p.i. of 2.3 (sensitivity/specificity: 96.4%/100%) and 2.4 (94.2%/100%), respectively, distinguished normal and abnormal metabolic activity in the larynx. When laryngitis and tumors were compared, the SUVmax cut-off values obtained after initial and delayed imaging were 3.6 (87.5%/52.0%) and 6.1 (58.3%/84%), respectively. The RI-SUVmax of 1.3% (71.4%/88.1%) suggested abnormality, while RI-SUVmax of 6.6%, malignant etiology (75.0%/80.0%).


Conclusions
In this study, the sequential DTP scanning protocol improved the sensitivity and specificity of the PET/CT method in terms of differential diagnosis within the larynx.","Reports of practical oncology and radiotherapy : journal of Greatpoland Cancer Center in Poznan and Polish Society of Radiation Oncology",32477019,18F-FDG,"dual-time-point fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose",NULL,NULL,NULL

20063,"In Vivo Evaluation and Dosimetry Estimate for a High Affinity Affibody PET Tracer Targeting PD-L1.","PURPOSE
In vivo imaging of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) during immunotherapy could potentially monitor changing PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 expression heterogeneity within and across tumors. Some protein constructs can be used for same-day positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Previously, we evaluated the PD-L1-targeting Affibody molecule [18F]AlF-NOTA-ZPD-L1_1 as a PET tracer in a mouse tumor model of human PD-L1 expression. In this study, we evaluated the affinity-matured Affibody molecule ZPD-L1_4, to determine if improved affinity for PD-L1 resulted in increased in vivo targeting of PD-L1.


PROCEDURES
ZPD-L1_4 was conjugated with NOTA and radiolabeled with either [18F]AlF or 68Ga. [18F]AlF-NOTA-ZPD-L1_4 and [68Ga]NOTA-ZPD-L1_4 were evaluated in immunocompromised mice with LOX (PD-L1+) and SUDHL6 (PD-L1-) tumors with PET and ex vivo biodistribution measurements. In addition, whole-body PET studies were performed in rhesus monkeys to predict human biodistribution in a model with tracer binding to endogenous PD-L1, and to calculate absorbed radiation doses.


RESULTS
Ex vivo biodistribution measurements showed that both tracers had > 25 fold higher accumulation in LOX tumors than SUDHL6 ([18F]AlF-NOTA-ZPD-L1_4: LOX: 8.7 ± 0.7 %ID/g (N = 4) SUDHL6: 0.2 ± 0.01 %ID/g (N = 6), [68Ga]NOTA-ZPD-L1_4: LOX: 15.8 ± 1.0 %ID/g (N = 6) SUDHL6: 0.6 ± 0.1 %ID/g (N = 6)), considerably higher than ZPD-L1_1. In rhesus monkeys, both PET tracers showed fast clearance through kidneys and low background signal in the liver ([18F]AlF-NOTA-ZPD-L1_4: 1.26 ± 0.13 SUV, [68Ga]NOTA-ZPD-L1_4: 1.11 ± 0.06 SUV). PD-L1-expressing lymph nodes were visible in PET images, indicating in vivo PD-L1 targeting. Dosimetry estimates suggest that both PET tracers can be used for repeated clinical studies, although high kidney accumulation may limit allowable radioactive doses.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]AlF-NOTA-ZPD-L1_4 and [68Ga]NOTA-ZPD-L1_4 are promising candidates for same-day clinical PD-L1 PET imaging, warranting clinical evaluation. The ability to use either [18F] or [68Ga] may expand access to clinical sites.","Molecular imaging and biology",33098025,[68Ga]NOTA-ZPD-L1_4,[68Ga],PD-L1,NULL,NULL

Healthy anesthetized rats had [11C]UCB-J PET and arterial blood sampling. We compared different models describing [11C]UCB-J brain uptake kinetics to determine its regional distribution. Blocking studies were performed with levetiracetam (LEV), an antiepileptic SV2A antagonist. Tracer binding was measured in rodent unilateral acute lesion models of Parkinsonism and Huntington's disease, induced with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) and quinolinic acid (QA), respectively. [3H]UCB-J autoradiography was performed in postmortem tissue. Rat brain showed high and fast [11C]UCB-J uptake and washout with up to 80% blockade by LEV. [11C]UCB-J PET showed a 6.2% decrease in ipsilateral striatal SV2A binding after 6-OHDA and 39.3% and 55.1% decreases after moderate and high dose QA confirmed by autoradiography.

37032,"[68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-E[(cRGDyK)]2 PET and hyperpolarized [1-13C] pyruvate MRSI (hyperPET) in canine cancer patients: simultaneous imaging of angiogenesis and the Warburg effect.","PURPOSE
Cancer has a multitude of phenotypic expressions and identifying these are important for correct diagnosis and treatment selection. Clinical molecular imaging such as positron emission tomography can access several of these hallmarks of cancer non-invasively. Recently, hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy with [1-13C] pyruvate has shown great potential to probe metabolic pathways. Here, we investigate simultaneous dual modality clinical molecular imaging of angiogenesis and deregulated energy metabolism in canine cancer patients.


METHODS
Canine cancer patients (n = 11) underwent simultaneous [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-E[(cRGDyK)]2 (RGD) PET and hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate-MRSI (hyperPET). Standardized uptake values and [1-13C]lactate to total 13C ratio were quantified and compared generally and voxel-wise.


RESULTS
Ten out of 11 patients showed clear tumor uptake of [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD at both 20 and 60 min after injection, with an average SUVmean of 1.36 ± 0.23 g/mL and 1.13 ± 0.21 g/mL, respectively. A similar pattern was seen for SUVmax values, which were 2.74 ± 0.41 g/mL and 2.37 ± 0.45 g/mL. The [1-13C]lactate generation followed patterns previously reported. We found no obvious pattern or consistent correlation between the two modalities. Voxel-wise tumor values of RGD uptake and lactate generation analysis revealed a tendency for each canine cancer patient to cluster in separated groups.


CONCLUSION
We demonstrated combined imaging of [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD-PET for angiogenesis and hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate-MRSI for probing energy metabolism. The results suggest that [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD-PET and [1-13C]pyruvate-MRSI may provide complementary information, indicating that hyperPET imaging of angiogenesis and energy metabolism is able to aid in cancer phenotyping, leading to improved therapy planning.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32621132,[68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD-PET,[1-13C]pyruvate-MRSI,NULL,NULL,NULL

The primary objective of this study was to assess whether 18F-NaF activity can assess the presence and predict the progression of CT detectable vascular calcification.


METHODS AND RESULTS
The data of two longitudinal studies in which patients received a 18F-NaF PET-CT at baseline and after 6 months or 1-year follow-up were used. The target to background ratio (TBR) was measured on PET at baseline and CT calcification was quantified in the femoral arteries at baseline and follow-up. 128 patients were included. A higher TBR at baseline was associated with higher calcification mass at baseline and calcification progression (β = 1.006 [1.005-1.007] and β = 1.002 [1.002-1.003] in the studies with 6 months and 1-year follow-up, respectively). In areas without calcification at baseline and where calcification developed at follow-up, the TBR was .11-.13 (P < .001) higher compared to areas where no calcification developed.


CONCLUSION
The activity of 18F-NaF is related to the amount of calcification and calcification progression. In areas where calcification formation occurred, the TBR was slightly but significantly higher.","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology",31975332,18F-NaF,"18F-sodium fluoride",CT,NULL,NULL
13894,"A novel PET tracer 18F-deoxy-thiamine: synthesis, metabolic kinetics, and evaluation on cerebral thiamine metabolism status.","BACKGROUND
Some neuropsychological diseases are associated with abnormal thiamine metabolism, including Korsakoff-Wernicke syndrome and Alzheimer's disease. However, in vivo detection of the status of brain thiamine metabolism is still unavailable and needs to be developed.


METHODS
A novel PET tracer of 18F-deoxy-thiamine was synthesized using an automated module via a two-step route. The main quality control parameters, such as specific activity and radiochemical purity, were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Radiochemical concentration was determined by radioactivity calibrator. Metabolic kinetics and the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in brains of mice and marmosets were studied by micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). In vivo stability, renal excretion rate, and biodistribution of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the mice were assayed using HPLC and γ-counter, respectively. Also, the correlation between the retention of cerebral 18F-deoxy-thiamine in 60 min after injection as represented by the area under the curve (AUC) and blood thiamine levels was investigated.


RESULTS
The 18F-deoxy-thiamine was stable both in vitro and in vivo. The uptake and clearance of 18F-deoxy-thiamine were quick in the mice. It reached the max standard uptake value (SUVmax) of 4.61 ± 0.53 in the liver within 1 min, 18.67 ± 7.04 in the kidney within half a minute. The SUV dropped to 0.72 ± 0.05 and 0.77 ± 0.35 after 60 min of injection in the liver and kidney, respectively. After injection, kidney, liver, and pancreas exhibited high accumulation level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine, while brain, muscle, fat, and gonad showed low accumulation concentration, consistent with previous reports on thiamine distribution in mice. Within 90 min after injection, the level of 18F-deoxy-thiamine in the brain of C57BL/6 mice with thiamine deficiency (TD) was 1.9 times higher than that in control mice, and was 3.1 times higher in ICR mice with TD than that in control mice. The AUC of the tracer in the brain of marmosets within 60 min was 29.33 ± 5.15 and negatively correlated with blood thiamine diphosphate levels (r = - 0.985, p = 0.015).


CONCLUSION
The 18F-deoxy-thiamine meets the requirements for ideal PET tracer for in vivo detecting the status of cerebral thiamine metabolism.","EJNMMI research",33079296,18F-deoxy-thiamine,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
46258,"Diagnostic Accuracy of PET Tracers for the Differentiation of Tumor Progression from Treatment-Related Changes in High-Grade Glioma: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis.","Posttreatment high-grade gliomas are usually monitored with contrast-enhanced MRI, but its diagnostic accuracy is limited as it cannot adequately distinguish between true tumor progression and treatment-related changes. According to recent Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology recommendations, PET overcomes this limitation. However, it is currently unknown which tracer yields the best results. Therefore, a systematic review and metaanalysis were performed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the different PET tracers in differentiating tumor progression from treatment-related changes in high-grade glioma patients. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase were searched systematically. Study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by 2 authors. Metaanalysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model when at least 5 studies were included. Results: The systematic review included 39 studies (11 tracers). 18F-FDG (12 studies, 171 lesions) showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 84% (95% confidence interval, 72%-92%) and 84% (95% confidence interval, 69%-93%), respectively. O-(2-18F-fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) (7 studies, 172 lesions) demonstrated a sensitivity of 90% (95% confidence interval, 81%-95%) and specificity of 85% (95% confidence interval, 71%-93%). For S-11C-methyl)-l-methionine (11C-MET) (8 studies, 151 lesions), sensitivity was 93% (95% confidence interval, 80%-98%) and specificity was 82% (95% confidence interval, 68%-91%). The numbers of included studies for the other tracers were too low to combine, but sensitivity and specificity ranged between 93%-100% and 0%-100%, respectively, for 18F-FLT; 85%-100% and 72%-100%, respectively, for 3,4-dihydroxy-6-18F-fluoro-l-phenylalanine (18F-FDOPA); and 100% and 70%-88%, respectively, for 11C-choline. Conclusion: 18F-FET and 11C-MET, both amino-acid tracers, showed a comparably higher sensitivity than 18F-FDG in the differentiation between tumor progression and treatment-related changes in high-grade glioma patients. The evidence for other tracers is limited; thus, 18F-FET and 11C-MET are preferred when available.

57312,"Prevalence of hypoxia and correlation with glycolytic metabolism and angiogenic biomarkers in metastatic colorectal carcinoma.","PURPOSE
Hypoxia is associated with aggressive tumour behaviour and can influence response to systemic therapy and radiotherapy. The prevalence of hypoxia in metastatic colorectal cancer is poorly understood, and the relationship of hypoxia to patient outcomes has not been clearly established. The aims of the study were to evaluate hypoxia in metastatic colorectal cancer with [18F]Fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO PET) and correlate these findings with glycolytic metabolism ([18F]FDG PET) and angiogenic blood biomarkers and patient outcomes.


METHODS
Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer received routine staging investigations and both [18F] FMISO PET and [18F] FDG PET scans. Correlative blood specimens were also obtained at the time of the [18F] FMISO PET scan. Patient follow-up was performed to establish progression-free survival.


RESULTS
A total of 40 patients were recruited into the trial. [18F]FMISO and [18F]FDG PET scans showed a significant correlation of SUVmax (p = 0.003). A significant correlation of progression-free survival and [18F] FMISO TNR (p = 0.02) and overall survival with [18F]FMISO TNR (p = 0.003) and [18F]FDG TGV (p = 0.02) was observed. Serum levels of osteopontin, but not VEGF, correlated with [18F] FMISO and [18F]FDG PET scan parameters.

To investigate whether radiomic features from (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography [(18F)-FDG PET/CT] can predict epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status and prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.


Methods
One hundred and seventy-four consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinoma underwent (18F)-FDG PET/CT and EGFR gene testing were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic features combined with clinicopathological factors to construct a random forest (RF) model to identify EGFR mutation status. The mutant/wild-type model was trained on a training group (n=139) and validated in an independent validation group (n=35). The second RF classifier predicting the 19/21 mutation site was also built and evaluated in an EGFR mutation subset (training group, n=80; validation group, n=25). Radiomic score and 5 clinicopathological factors were integrated into a multivariate Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model for predicting overall survival (OS). AUC (the area under the receiver characteristic curve) and C-index were calculated to evaluate the model's performance.


Results
Of 174 patients, 109 (62.6%) harbored EGFR mutations, 21L858R was the most common mutation type [55.9% (61/109)]. The mutant/wild-type model was identified in the training (AUC, 0.77) and validation (AUC, 0.71) groups. The 19/21 mutation site model had an AUC of 0.82 and 0.73 in the training and validation groups, respectively. The C-index of the CPH model was 0.757. The survival time between targeted therapy and chemotherapy for patients with EGFR mutations was significantly different (P=0.03).

In this study, four flexible multidentate benzyldiamine derivatives as potential probes for cerebrovascular Aβ deposition were designed and synthesized. In in vitro inhibition assays, the ligands 18-21 displayed high affinities for Aβ aggregates with Ki values of 1.45 ± 0.53 nM, 1.68 ± 0.35 nM, 1.16 ± 0.23 nM and 1.72 ± 0.19 nM, respectively. A significant improvement in the binding affinity over the monomer, compounds 9-12 or benzyldiamine derivatives, demonstrated the applicability of the multidentate approach. The underlying mechanism of these novel Aβ agents was explored by molecular docking technique, which theoretically verified the high affinities of the multidentate benzyldiamine derivatives for Aβ aggregates. Moreover, the molecular masses of the ligands 18-21 are more than 700 Dalton, which are believed to be hardly capable of penetrating blood brain barrier. In this regard, these ligands could be used to distinguish CAA from Alzheimer's disease which is another Aβ-related disorder disease. To convert these ligands to positron emission tomography imaging agents, we attempted to radiosynthesize [18F]18.

19935,"Development of Folate Receptor-Targeted PET Radiopharmaceuticals for Tumor Imaging-A Bench-to-Bedside Journey.","The folate receptor-α (FR-α) is overexpressed in many epithelial cancers, including ovary, uterus, kidneys, breast, lung, colon and prostate carcinomas, but shows limited expression in normal tissues such as kidneys, salivary glands, choroid plexus and placenta. FR-α has therefore emerged as a promising target for the delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents to FR-positive tumors. A series of folate-based PET (positron emission tomography) radiopharmaceuticals have been developed for the selective targeting of FR-positive malignancies. This review provides an overview on the research progress made so far regarding the design, radiosynthesis and the utility of the folate-derived PET radioconjugates for targeting FR-positive tumors. For the most part, results from folate radioconjugates labeled with fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 109.8 min) and gallium-68 (t1/2 = 67.7 min) have been presented but folates labeled with "exotic" and new PET radionuclides such as copper-64 (t1/2 = 12.7 h), terbium-152 (t1/2 = 17.5 h), scandium-44 (t1/2 = 3.97 h), cobalt-55 (t1/2 = 17.5 h) and zirconium-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h) are also discussed.

This study aimed to compare the performance of 68Ga-labelled fibroblast activating protein inhibitor (FAPI) PET and 18F-FDG PET for imaging of hepatic tumours.


METHODS
We prospectively assessed 20 patients with suspected intrahepatic lesions. Tumour radiological features, pathology, or follow-up examinations were assessed as ground truth in correlation with PET scans. Semiquantitative analysis was additionally performed by measuring the standardised uptake value (SUV). Tumour-to-liver background ratios (TBR) were calculated and compared between 68Ga-FAPI PET and 18F-FDG PET. FAPI expression was assessed by immunochemistry in samples obtained from 7 patients with hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC)/intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or granulomas.


RESULTS
Primary intrahepatic tumours, including 16 HCC in 14 patients and 4 ICC in 3 patients with extrahepatic metastases, were determined by histology (n = 14) and clinical examinations (n = 3). Based on visual analysis, 17 patients presented elevated 68Ga-FAPI uptake (sensitivity: 100%, specificity: 100%), while 7 patients presented 18F-FDG avid tumours (sensitivity: 58.8%, specificity: 100%). 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT identified 17 extrahepatic metastases vs. 13 in 18F-FDG PET/CT in 2 ICC patients. Three benign liver nodules in three patients showed negligible uptake in dual-PET scans. The SUVmax_HCC = 8.47 ± 4.06 and TBRmax_HCC = 7.13 ± 5.52, and SUVmax_ICC = 14.14 ± 2.20 TBRmax_ICC = 26.46 ± 4.94 in 68Ga-FAPI-04 PET/CT were significantly higher than the 18F-FDG uptake presenting SUVmax_HCC = 4.86 ± 3.58 and TBRmax_HCC = 2.39 ± 2.21, and SUVmax_ICC = 9.19 ± 3.60 and TBRmax_ICC = 2.39 ± 2.21 (all p values < 0.05).

The spatiotemporal dynamics of dysregulated pH across disease remain elusive, and current diagnostic strategies do not provide localization of pH alterations. We sought to explore if PET imaging using hydrophobic cyclic peptides that partition into the cellular membrane at low extracellular pH (denoted as pH [low] insertion cycles, or pHLIC) can permit accurate in vivo visualization of acidosis. Methods: Acid-sensitive cyclic peptide c[E4W5C] pHLIC was conjugated to bifunctional maleimide-NO2A and radiolabeled with 64Cu (half-life, 12.7 h). C57BL/6J mice were administered lipopolysaccharide (15 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) and serially imaged with [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] over 24 h. Ex vivo autoradiography was performed on resected brain slices and subsequently stained with cresyl violet to enable high-resolution spatial analysis of tracer accumulation. A non-pH-sensitive cell-penetrating control peptide (c[R4W5C]) was used to confirm specificity of [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C]. CD11b (macrophage/microglia) and TMEM119 (microglia) immunostaining was performed to correlate extent of neuroinflammation with [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] PET signal. Results: [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] radiochemical yield and purity were more than 95% and more than 99%, respectively, with molar activity of more than 0.925 MBq/nmol. Significantly increased [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] uptake was observed in lipopolysaccharide-treated mice (vs. vehicle) within peripheral tissues, including blood, lungs, liver, and small intestines (P < 0.001-0.05). Additionally, there was significantly increased [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] uptake in the brains of lipopolysaccharide-treated animals. Autoradiography confirmed increased uptake in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and hypothalamus of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice (vs. vehicle). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed microglial or macrophage infiltration, suggesting activation in brain regions containing increased tracer uptake. [64Cu]Cu-c[R4W5C] demonstrated significantly reduced uptake in the brain and periphery of lipopolysaccharide mice compared with the acid-mediated [64Cu]Cu-c[E4W5C] tracer. Conclusion: Here, we demonstrate that a pH-sensitive PET tracer specifically detects acidosis in regions associated with sepsis-driven proinflammatory responses.

To determine the clinically acceptable level of reduction in the injected fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) dose in dedicated breast positron emission tomography (dbPET).


METHODS
A breast phantom with four spheres exhibiting various diameters (5, 7.5, 10, and 16 mm), a background 18F-FDG radioactivity of 2.28 kBq/mL, and a sphere-to-background radioactivity ratio of 8:1 was used. True dose-reduced dbPET images were obtained by data acquisition for 20 min in list mode at multiple time points over 7 h of radioactive decay. Simulated dose-reduced images were generated by reconstruction with a portion of the list mode acquisition data. True and simulated dose-reduced images were visually and quantitatively compared. On the basis of the phantom study, dbPET images for 32 breasts of 28 women with abnormal uptake were generated after simulated reduction of the injected 18F-FDG doses; these images were compared with those acquired using current clinical doses.


RESULTS
There were no qualitative differences between true and simulated dose-reduced phantom images. The phantom study revealed that the minimal required dose was 12.5% for the detection of 5-mm spheres and 25% for precise semi-quantification of FDG in the spheres. The 7-min reconstruction with a 100% dose was defined as the reference for the clinical study. The image quality and lesion conspicuity were clinically acceptable for the 25% dose images. Lesion detectability on the 12.5% dose images was maintained despite image quality degradation.


CONCLUSIONS
In summary, 25% of the standard 18F-FDG dose for dbPET can provide a clinically acceptable image quality, while 12.5% of the standard dose results in acceptable quality in terms of lesion detection when lesions are located at a sufficient distance from the edge of the dbPET detector.","EJNMMI physics",31784863,18F-FDG,"fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose",dbPET,NULL,NULL

A stimuli-responsive probe based on the peptide sequence Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD), [18F]DEVD-Cys(StBu)-PPG(CBT)-AmBF3 ([18F]1), for PET imaging of tumor apoptosis was designed and prepared. This study aimed to develop a novel smart probe using a convenient radiosynthesis method and to fully examine the sensitivity and specificity of the probe response to the tumor treatment. Methods: The radiolabelling precursor DEVD-Cys(StBu)-PPG(CBT)-AmBF3 (1) was synthesized through multistep reactions. The reduction together with caspase-controlled macrocyclization and self-assembly of 1 was characterized and validated in vitro. After [18F]fluorination in the buffer (pH= 2.5), the radiolabelling yield (RLY), radiochemical purity (RCP) and stability of the probe [18F]1 in PBS and mouse serum were investigated by radio-HPLC. The sensitivity and specificity of [18F]1 for detecting the drug-induced apoptosis was fully evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The effect of cold precursor 1 on the cell uptake and tumor imaging of [18F]1 was also assessed. The level of activated caspase-3 in Hela cells and tumors with or without apoptosis induction was analyzed and compared by western blotting and histological staining. Results: The whole radiosynthesis process of [18F]1 was around 25 min with RLY of 50%, RCP of over 99% and specific activity of 1.45 ± 0.4 Ci/µmol. The probe was very stable in both PBS and mouse serum within 4 h. It can be activated by caspase-3 and then undergo an intermolecular cyclization to form nanosized particles. The retained [18F]1 in DOX-treated HeLa cells was 2.2 folds of that in untreated cells. Within 1 h microPET imaging of the untreated Hela-bearing mice, the injection of [18F]1 resulted in the increase of the uptake ratio of tumor to muscle (T/M) only from 1.74 to 2.18, while in the DOX-treated Hela-bearing mice T/M increased from 1.88 to 10.52 and the co-injection of [18F]1 and 1 even led to the increase of T/M from 3.08 to 14.81. Conclusions: A caspase-responsive smart PET probe [18F]1 was designed and prepared in a kit-like manner. Co-injection of [18F]1 and 1 generated remarkably enhanced tumor uptake and signal-to-noise ratio in the tumor-bearing mice with drug-induced apoptosis, which correlated well with the expression level of activated caspase-3.

66163,"Evaluation of the total distribution volume of 18F-FBPA in normal tissues of healthy volunteers by non-compartmental kinetic modeling.","OBJECTIVE
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a noninvasive radiation therapy method for cancer treatment. In BNCT, 4-borono-2-[18F]-fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-FBPA) PET has been employed to estimate 10B accumulation in target tumors and normal tissues if 10B borono-L-phenylalanine (10B-BPA) is used as a boron carrier. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the total distribution volume (Vt) of 18F-FBPA in normal organs of healthy volunteers by kinetic analysis and to estimate boron concentration in normal organs for the therapeutic dose of 10B-BPA using obtained Vt values.


METHODS
Six healthy volunteers were injected with 18F-FBPA (3-5 MBq/kg), and 7 PET-CT scans were performed subsequently. 18F-FBPA radioactivity in whole blood and plasma was measured before, and eight times after the injection. PET images were analyzed by PMOD software. Twelve volumetric regions of interest including the brain, heart, right lung, spleen, liver, parotid salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, intestines, and bone marrow were drawn manually for each subject and analyzed with the Logan plot and two Ichise multilinear analyses (MA1 and MA2). The better model was defined by several goodness-of-fit parameters and residual distribution. After Vt values had been derived, boron concentration was estimated in ppm for the 10B-BPA-fructose (10B-BPA-fr) dose 30 g 1 and 2 h post-injection using Vt and interpolated plasma activity data.


RESULTS
The Ichise MA2 model showed the best fit among all models. Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) was the lowest for the Ichise's MA2 in all regions (mean AIC value - 14.0) comparing to the other models (Logan plot mean AIC 31.4; Ichise MA1 model mean AIC - 4.2). Mean Vt values of the Ichise MA2 model ranged from 0.94 ± 0.14 ml/ml in the pancreas to 0.16 ± 0.02 ml/ml in the right lung. Estimated boron concentration for 10B-BPA-fr had the highest value in the pancreas (14.0 ± 1.9 ppm 1 h after, and 5.7 ± 1.7 ppm 2 h after the 18F-FBPA administration) and the lowest value in the right lung (2.4 ± 0.3 ppm 1 h, and 1.0 ± 0.3 ppm 2 h post-injection).


CONCLUSION
The 10B concentration in normal tissues was best estimated using Vt values of 18F-FBPA with the Ichise multilinear analysis 2 (MA2).

Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a promising candidate positron emission tomography (PET) imaging biomarker altered in various disorders, including vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, and depression, known to regulate levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and play an important role in neurovascular coupling. [18F]FNDP, a PET radiotracer for imaging sEH, was evaluated through quantitative PET imaging in the baboon brain, radiometabolite analysis, and radiation dosimetry estimate.


METHODS
Baboon [18F]FNDP dynamic PET studies were performed at baseline and with blocking doses of the selective sEH inhibitor AR-9281 to evaluate sEH binding specificity. Radiometabolites of [18F]FNDP in mice and baboons were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Regional brain distribution volume (VT) of [18F]FNDP was computed from PET using radiometabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Full body distribution of [18F]FNDP was studied in CD-1 mice, and the human effective dose was estimated using OLINDA/EXM software.


RESULTS
[18F]FNDP exhibited high and rapid brain uptake in baboons. AR-9281 blocked [18F]FNDP uptake dose-dependently with a baseline VT of 10.9 ± 2.4 mL/mL and a high-dose blocking VT of 1.0 ± 0.09 mL/mL, indicating substantial binding specificity (91.70 ± 1.74%). The VND was estimated as 0.865 ± 0.066 mL/mL. The estimated occupancy values of AR-9281 were 99.2 ± 1.1% for 1 mg/kg, 88.6 ± 1.3% for 0.1 mg/kg, and 33.8 ± 3.8% for 0.02 mg/kg. Murine biodistribution of [18F]FNDP enabled an effective dose estimate for humans (0.032 mSv/MBq). [18F]FNDP forms hydrophilic radiometabolites in murine and non-human primate plasma. However, only minute amounts of the radiometabolites entered the animal brain (< 2% in mice).

67824,"Usefulness of Brain Positron Emission Tomography with Different Tracers in the Evaluation of Patients with Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalous.","Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is the only form of dementia that can be cured by surgery. Its diagnosis relies on clinical and radiological criteria. Identifying patients who can benefit from surgery is challenging, as other neurological diseases can be concomitant or mimic iNPH. We performed a systematic review on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) in iNPH. We retrieved 35 papers evaluating four main functional aspects with different PET radiotracers: (1) PET with amyloid tracers, revealing Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 20-57% of suspected iNPH patients, could be useful in predictions of surgical outcome. (2) PET with radiolabeled water as perfusion tracer showed a global decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) and regional reduction of CBF in basal ganglia in iNPH; preoperative perfusion parameters could predict surgical outcome. (3) PET with 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose ([18F]FDG ) showed a global reduction of glucose metabolism without a specific cortical pattern and a hypometabolism in basal ganglia; [18F]FDG PET may identify a coexisting neurodegenerative disease, helping in patient selection for surgery; postsurgery increase in glucose metabolism was associated with clinical improvement. (4) Dopaminergic PET imaging showed a postsynaptic D2 receptor reduction and striatal upregulation of D2 receptor after treatment, associated with clinical improvement. Overall, PET imaging could be a useful tool in iNPH diagnoses and treatment response.","International journal of molecular sciences",32906629,"[18F]FDG PET",NULL,"D2 receptor",NULL,NULL

To provide a systematic review regarding the diagnostic performance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) compared to 18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) focused on nodal and distant staging in breast cancer patients.


METHODS
The PubMed and Embase databases were searched for relevant publications until April 2020. Two independent reviewers searched for eligible articles based on predefined in- and exclusion criteria, assessed quality and extracted data.


RESULTS
Eleven eligible studies were selected from 561 publications identified by the search. In seven studies, PET/CT was compared with PET/MRI, and in five, PET/CT with DWI. Significantly higher sensitivity for PET/MRI compared to PET/CT in a lesion-based analysis was reported for all lesions together (77% versus 89%) in one study, osseous metastases (69-99% versus 92-98%) in two studies and hepatic metastases (70-75% versus 80-100%) in one study. Moreover, PET/MRI revealed a significantly higher amount of osseous metastases (90 versus 141) than PET/CT. PET/CT is associated with a statistically higher specificity than PET/MRI in the lesion detection of all lesions together (98% versus 96%) and of osseous metastases (100% versus 95%), both in one study. None of the reviewed studies reported significant differences between PET/CT and DWI for any of the evaluated sites. There is a trend toward higher specificity for PET/CT.


CONCLUSION
In general, there is a trend toward higher sensitivity and lower specificity of PET/MRI when compared to PET/CT. Results on the diagnostic performance of DWI are conflicting. Rather than evaluating it separate, it seems to have complementary value when combined with other MR sequences.","Nuclear medicine communications",32769814,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT)",in-,"MR sequences",NULL

Methods: Six healthy volunteer subjects (3 males, 3 females) underwent multiple whole-body PET acquisitions at scheduled time points up to 248 minutes after the administration of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 (mean activity 220; range, 210-228 MBq). PET scans were conducted in three separate sessions and subjects were encouraged to void between sessions. Blood and urine samples were collected for up to 4 hours post-injection to assess metabolite-corrected radioactivity in whole blood, plasma and urine. Quantitative measurements of 18F radioactivity in volumes of interest (VOIs) over target organs were determined directly from the PET images at 8 time points and normalized time-activity concentration curves were generated. These normalized cumulated activities were then inputted into the OLINDA/EXM package to calculate the internal radiation dosimetry and the subjects' effective dose. Results: 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 was well tolerated. One adverse event (mild headache, not requiring medication) was considered possibly related to 18F-rhPSMA-7.3: because of the temporal association with 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 injection, a causal relationship could not be excluded. The calculated effective dose was 0.0141 mSv/MBq when using a 3.5-hour voiding interval. The organs with the highest absorbed dose per unit of administered radioactivity were the adrenals (mean absorbed dose, 0.1835 mSv/MBq), the kidneys (mean absorbed dose, 0.1722 mSv/MBq), the submandibular glands (mean absorbed dose, 0.1479 mSv) and the parotid glands (mean absorbed dose, 0.1137 mSv/MBq). At the end of the first scanning session (mean time, 111 min post-injection), an average of 7.2% (range, 4.4-9.0%) of the injected radioactivity of 18F-rhPSMA-7.3 was excreted into urine.

16917,"Prototype device for endoventricular beta-emitting radiotracer detection and molecularly-guided intervention.","BACKGROUND
We have set out to develop a catheter-based theranostic system that: (a) identifies diseased and at-risk myocardium via endocardial detection of systemically delivered β-emitting radiotracers and (b) utilizes molecular signals to guide delivery of therapeutics to appropriate tissue via direct intramyocardial injection.


METHODS
Our prototype device consists of a miniature β-radiation detector contained within the tip of a flexible intravascular catheter. The catheter can be adapted to incorporate an injection port and retractable needle for therapeutic delivery. The performance of the β-detection catheter was assessed in vitro with various β-emitting radionuclides and ex vivo in hearts of pigs following systemic injection of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) at 1-week post-myocardial infarction. Regional catheter-based endocardial measurements of 18F activity were compared to regional tissue activity from PET/CT images and gamma counting.


RESULTS
The β-detection catheter demonstrated sensitive in vitro detection of β-radiation from 22Na (β+), 18F (β+), and 204Tl (β-), with minimal sensitivity to γ-radiation. For 18F, the catheter demonstrated a sensitivity of 4067 counts/s/μCi in contact and a spatial resolution of 1.1 mm FWHM. Ex vivo measurements of endocardial 18F activity with the β-detection catheter in the chronic pig infarct model demonstrated good qualitative and quantitative correlation with regional tissue activity from PET/CT images and gamma counting.


CONCLUSION
The prototype β-detection catheter demonstrates sensitive and selective detection of β- and β+ emissions over a wide range of energies and enables high-fidelity ex vivo characterization of endocardial activity from systemically delivered 18F-FDG.","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology",32820423,18F,18F-FDG.,NULL,"β-detection catheter",NULL

We compared Al18F- and 68Ga-labeled LLP2A peptides for PET imaging of VLA-4 expression in melanoma. The peptidomimetic ligand LLP2A was modified with chelator 2-S-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA), and the resulting NOTA-PEG4-LLP2A peptide was then radiolabeled with Al18F or 68Ga. The two labeled peptides were assayed for in vitro and in vivo VLA-4 targeting efficiency. Good Al18F and 68Ga radiolabeling yields were achieved, and the resulting PET tracers showed good serum stability. In the in vivo evaluation of the B16F10 xenograft mouse model, both tracers exhibited high accumulation with good contrast in static PET images. Compared with 68Ga-NOTA-PEG4-LLP2A, Al18F-NOTA-PEG4-LLP2A resulted in relatively higher background, including higher liver uptake (1 h: 20.1 ± 2.6 vs. 15.3 ± 1.7%ID/g, P < 0.05; 2 h: 11.0 ± 1.2 vs. 8.0 ± 0.8%ID/g, P < 0.05) and lower tumor-to-blood ratios (2.5 ± 0.4 vs. 3.3 ± 0.5 at 1 h, P < 0.05; 5.1 ± 0.9 vs. 7.3 ± 0.6 at 2 h, P < 0.01) at some time points.

PET/CT using 68Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs is superior to earlier agents, but the rapid physical decay of the radionuclide poses logistic and regulatory challenges. 64Cu has attractive physical characteristics for imaging and provides a diagnostic partner for the therapeutic radionuclide 67Cu. Based on promising preclinical studies, we have performed a first-time-in-humans trial of 64Cu-MeCOSar-Tyr3-octreotate (64Cu-SARTATE) to assess its safety and ability to localize disease at early and late imaging time-points. Methods: In a prospective trial, 10 patients with known neuroendocrine neoplasia and positive for uptake on 68Ga-DOTA-octreotate (68Ga-DOTATATE) PET/CT underwent serial PET/CT imaging at 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h after injection of 64Cu-SARTATE. Adverse reactions were recorded, and laboratory testing was performed during infusion and at 1 and 7 d after imaging. Images were analyzed for lesion and normal-organ uptake and clearance to assess lesion contrast and perform dosimetry estimates. Results: 64Cu-SARTATE was well tolerated during infusion and throughout the study, with 3 patients experiencing mild infusion-related events. High lesion uptake and retention were observed at all imaging time-points. There was progressive hepatic clearance over time, providing the highest lesion-to-liver contrast at 24 h. Image quality remained high at this time. Comparison of 64Cu-SARTATE PET/CT obtained at 4 h to 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT obtained at 1 h indicated comparable or superior lesion detection in all patients, especially in the liver. As expected, the highest early physiologic organ uptake was in the kidneys, liver, and spleen. Conclusion: 64Cu-SARTATE is safe and has excellent imaging characteristics. High late-retention in tumor and clearance from the liver suggest suitability for diagnostic studies and for prospective dosimetry for 67Cu-SARTATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, and the half-life of 64Cu would also facilitate good-manufacturing-practice production and distribution to sites without access to 68Ga.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",30442752,68Ga,"68Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs","somatostatin receptor",NULL,NULL

Positron-emission tomography (PET) using either 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) or amyloid-tracers is a well-established, non-invasive tool in the clinical diagnostics of AD assessing two major pathological hallmarks. 18F-FDG-PET is able to detect early changes in cerebral glucose metabolism and amyloid-PET shows cerebral amyloid load. However, the suitability of 18F-FDG- and amyloid-PET in the widely used 5XFAD mouse model of AD is unclear as only a few studies on the use of PET biomarkers are available showing some conflicting results. The aim of this study was the evaluation of 18F-FDG-PET and amyloid-PET in 5XFAD mice in comparison to neurological deficits and neuropathological changes. Seven- and 12-month-old male 5XFAD mice showed a significant reduction in brain glucose metabolism in 18F-FDG-PET and amyloid-PET with 18F-Florbetaben demonstrated an increased cerebral amyloid deposition (n = 4-6 per group). Deficits in spatial reference memory were detected in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice in the Morris Water Maze (n = 10-12 per group). Furthermore, an increased plaque load and gliosis could be proven immunohistochemically in 5XFAD mice (n = 4-6 per group). PET biomarkers 18F-FDG and 18F-Florbetaben detected cerebral hypometabolism and increased plaque load even before the onset of severe memory deficits.

26601,"Correlation between preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and postoperative short-term prognosis in lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia after lung resection.","BACKGROUND
The present study aimed to investigate the correlation between preoperative 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT findings and short-term survival in lung cancer patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP).


METHODS
We retrospectively reviewed the data of 425 patients who underwent lung resection for non-small cell lung cancer without preoperative radiation therapy between November 2012 and October 2017. The maximum SUV (SUVmax) in the IIP area except the lung cancer site was measured in each patient.


RESULTS
Thirty-one of the 425 patients (7.3%) showed findings of IIP in chest CT. Five of the 31 patients (16.1%) developed acute exacerbation (AE) after lung resection (AE+ group). Twenty-six of the 31 patients (83.9%) did not develop AE (AE- group). In the AE+ group, 18F-FDG SUVmax in the IIP area was significantly higher (1.9 ± 0.6 vs. 2.7 ± 0.7, p = 0.02) compared with that in the AE- group. The receiver operating characteristic analysis identified an SUVmax threshold score of 2.55 (p = 0.02) for AE. There was no 90-day mortality in the patients with SUVmax < 2.55 (n = 25). On the other hand, the 90-day mortality rate in patients with SUVmax ≥ 2.55 (n = 6) was 33.3% (2 patients).


CONCLUSIONS
18F-FDG PET/CT may predict AE after lung resection and could be related to short-term survival in lung cancer patients with IIP. Further investigations are needed to improve the prognosis in patients with high SUVmax in the IIP area.","Respiratory investigation",33004286,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG SUVmax",CT,"lung cancer site",NULL
32788,"Principal components of tau positron emission tomography and longitudinal tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease.","BACKGROUND
We aimed to investigate the clinical correlates of principal components (PCs) of tau positron emission tomography (PET) and their predictability for longitudinal changes in tau accumulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD).


METHODS
We enrolled 272 participants who underwent two PET scans [18F-flortaucipir for tau and 18F-florbetaben for amyloid-β (Aβ)], brain magnetic resonance imaging, and neuropsychological tests as baseline assessments. Among them, 187 participants underwent the same follow-up assessments after an average of 2 years. Using Aβ-positive AD dementia-specific PCs obtained from the baseline scans of 56 Aβ-positive patients with AD dementia, we determined the expression of the first two PCs (PC1 and PC2) in all participants. We assessed the correlation of PC expression with baseline clinical characteristics and tau accumulation rates. Moreover, we investigated the predictability of PCs for the longitudinal tau accumulation in training and test sets.


RESULTS
PC1 corresponded to the tau distribution pattern in AD, while the two PC2 extremes reflected the parietal or temporal predominance of tau distribution. PC1 expression increased with tau burden and decreased with cognitive impairment, while PC2 expression decreased with advanced age and visuospatial and attention function deterioration. The tau accumulation rate was positively correlated with PC1 expression (greater tau burden) and negatively correlated with PC2 expression (temporal predominance). A regression model using both PCs could predict longitudinal changes in the tau burden (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.775, R2 = 0.456 in test set).


CONCLUSIONS
PC analysis of tau PET could be useful for evaluating disease progression, characterizing the tau distribution pattern, and predicting longitudinal tau accumulation.","Alzheimer's research & therapy",32967721,18F-florbetaben,NULL,PCs,NULL,NULL
37259,"Folate Receptor β-Targeted PET Imaging of Macrophages in Autoimmune Myocarditis.","Currently available imaging techniques have limited specificity for the detection of active myocardial inflammation. Aluminum 18F-labeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-N,N',N″-triacetic acid conjugated folate (18F-FOL) is a PET tracer targeting folate receptor β (FR-β), which is expressed on activated macrophages at sites of inflammation. We evaluated 18F-FOL PET for the detection of myocardial inflammation in rats with autoimmune myocarditis and studied the expression of FR-β in human cardiac sarcoidosis specimens. Methods: Myocarditis was induced by immunizing rats (n = 18) with porcine cardiac myosin in complete Freund adjuvant. Control rats (n = 6) were injected with Freund adjuvant alone. 18F-FOL was intravenously injected, followed by imaging with a small-animal PET/CT scanner and autoradiography. Contrast-enhanced high-resolution CT or 18F-FDG PET images were used for coregistration. Rat tissue sections and myocardial autopsy samples from 6 patients with cardiac sarcoidosis were studied for macrophages and FR-β. Results: The myocardium of 10 of 18 immunized rats showed focal macrophage-rich inflammatory lesions, with FR-β expression occurring mainly in M1-polarized macrophages. PET images showed focal myocardial 18F-FOL uptake colocalizing with inflammatory lesions (SUVmean, 2.1 ± 1.1), whereas uptake in the remote myocardium of immunized rats and controls was low (SUVmean, 0.4 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.1, respectively; P < 0.01). Ex vivo autoradiography of tissue sections confirmed uptake of 18F-FOL in myocardial inflammatory lesions. Uptake of 18F-FOL in inflamed myocardium was efficiently blocked by a nonlabeled FR-β ligand folate glucosamine in vivo. The myocardium of patients with cardiac sarcoidosis showed many FR-β-positive macrophages in inflammatory lesions. Conclusion: In a rat model of autoimmune myocarditis, 18F-FOL shows specific uptake in inflamed myocardium containing macrophages expressing FR-β, which were also present in human cardiac sarcoid lesions.

22848,"64Cu PET Imaging of the CXCR4 Chemokine Receptor Using a Cross-Bridged Cyclam Bis-Tetraazamacrocyclic Antagonist.","Expression of the chemokine receptor chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) plays an important role in cancer metastasis, in autoimmune diseases, and during stem cell-based repair processes after stroke and myocardial infarction. Previously reported PET imaging agents targeting CXCR4 suffer from either high nonspecific uptake or bind only to the human form of the receptor. The objective of this study was to develop a high-stability 64Cu-labeled small-molecule PET agent for imaging both human and murine CXCR4 chemokine receptors. Methods: Synthesis, radiochemistry, stability and radioligand binding assays were performed for the novel tracer 64Cu-CuCB-bicyclam. In vivo dynamic PET studies were performed on mice bearing U87 (CXCR4 low-expressing) and U87.CXCR4 (human-CXCR4 high-expressing) tumors. Biodistribution and receptor blocking studies were performed on CD1-IGS immunocompetent mice. CXCR4 expression on tumor and liver disaggregates was confirmed using a combination of immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and Western blot. Results: 64Cu-CuCB-bicyclam has a high affinity for both the human and the murine variants of the CXCR4 receptor (half-maximal inhibitory concentration, 8 nM [human]/2 nM [murine]) and can be obtained from the parent chelator that has low affinity. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate specific uptake in CXCR4-expressing cells that can be blocked by more than 90% using a higher-affinity antagonist, with limited uptake in non-CXCR4-expressing organs and high in vivo stability. The tracer was also able to selectively displace the CXCR4 antagonists AMD3100 and AMD3465 from the liver. Conclusion: The tetraazamacrocyclic small molecule 64Cu-CuCB-bicyclam has been shown to be an imaging agent for the CXCR4 receptor that is likely to be applicable across a range of species. It has high affinity and stability and is suitable for preclinical research in immunocompetent murine models.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31201250,64Cu-CuCB-bicyclam,"64Cu-labeled small-molecule PET agent","CXCR4 receptor",NULL,NULL
11456,"Plasma pharmacokinetic and metabolism of [18F]THK-5317 are dependent on sex.","INTRODUCTION
Tau deposition is one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be visualized and quantified using [18F]THK-5317 together with kinetic modeling. To determine the feasibility of this approach, we measured blood/plasma pharmacokinetics and radiotracer metabolism in female and male rats.


METHODS
Female and male rats (n = 11-12) were cannulated via the femoral artery for continuous blood sampling. Blood sampling was performed at regular intervals after intravenous injection of [18F]THK-5317. After collection of the last blood sample, animals were sacrificed, and organs were excised. Blood from minute 5, 20 and 60 was centrifuged to obtain plasma. Radiolabeled metabolites in plasma, brain, liver and urine were analyzed by radio-thin-layer chromatography (radio-TLC).


RESULTS
Plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism were significantly different between female and male rats. [18F]THK-5317 plasma clearance was faster in female (0.66 ± 0.08 mL/h/kg BW) than in male (0.52 ± 0.11 mL/h/kg BW) rats (p = .005). The percentage of unmetabolized parent was significantly different between both sexes at 20 min and 60 min p.i. In the liver, a 1.6-fold higher radioactivity concentration was found in male versus female animals and in addition also the percentage of unmetabolized parent was different.


CONCLUSION
Our results show pronounced sex differences in blood/plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism of [18F]THK-5317 in rats. Female animals showed a faster plasma clearance compared to males. These results underline the importance of investigating both sexes and also support the notion that individual input functions or sex-specific population-based input functions are needed for kinetic modeling analyses.


ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE
First preclinical study in rats showing pronounced sex differences in blood/plasma pharmacokinetics and metabolism of [18F]THK-5317.


IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE
Sex-specific differences might also be present in humans and thus clinical trials should have adequate sample size to account for effects in men and women separately.","Nuclear medicine and biology",31981857,[18F]THK-5317,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
14558,"The Role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in staging of gallbladder carcinomas.","BACKGROUND/AIMS
Gallbladder Carcinoma (GBC) is the most common and aggressive tumor of the biliary tract. Patients are typically diagnosed during advanced stages, and the mean overall survival is short. In our study, we aimed to demonstrate the uptake patterns of 18F-FDG PET/CT in GBC, as well as its association with survival and diagnostic value during the initial stage.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overall, 17 patients with GBC were retrospectively included in the study. 18F-FDG PET/CT study was performed for pretreatment staging. Two different standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean), metabolic tumor volume 40% (MTV40), and tumor lesion glycolysis (TLG) of the primary tumors were compared between the clinical and histopathological groups.


RESULTS
Of the 17 patients, 11 were women (64.7%), and 6 (35.3%) were men. The mean age of the patients was 69.7±8.8 years. 18F-FDG uptake was detected in all lesions. Mean SUVmax was calculated to be 15.4±13.7 (median=10.6, range=3.4-46.8). All distant metastases (52.9%) were detected in the liver. Semiquantitative metabolic parameters (SUVmax and SUVmean, MTV40, and TLG) obtained from patients with distant metastasis were not significantly higher than those without distant metastasis. Similar results were obtained in patients with and without nodal metastasis. No statistically significant intergroup difference was observed regarding metabolic parameters. However, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the patient's age and the SUVmax of the primary lesion and metastatic lymph nodes (r=-0.564, p=0.018). During 10.7±10.4 months of mean follow-up, the mean survival of patients with distant metastases (6.1±11.0 months) was significantly shorter than that of patients with no organ metastases (15.8±7.1 months).


CONCLUSION
In our study, distant metastases and age were observed to be crucial prognostic factors in patients with gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). In addition, we believe that 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging will help to stage the GBC, detect nodal and distant metastasis, and evaluate the metabolic state of gallbladder lesions.","The Turkish journal of gastroenterology : the official journal of Turkish Society of Gastroenterology",32141818,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL
27390,"Customized FreeSurfer-based brain atlas for diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra tool.","OBJECTIVE
Digital brain template and atlas designed for a specific group provide advantages for the analysis and interpretation of neuroimaging data, but require a significant workload for development. We developed a simple method to create customized brain atlas for diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) tool using FreeSurfer-generated volume-of-interest (FSVOI) images and validated.


METHODS
18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data were obtained from 248 participants of Alzheimer's disease spectrum (from cognitively normal to Alzheimer's disease dementia). To create a customized atlas, MR images of 84 amyloid-negative controls were first processed with FreeSurfer to obtain individual FSVOI and with DARTEL tool to create DARTEL template. Individual FSVOI images were spatially normalized, and each voxel was then labelled with a VOI label with maximum probability. Using these template and atlas, all images were normalized, and the regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were measured.


RESULTS
18F-florbetaben SUVR values measured with customized atlas showed excellent one-to-one correlation with SUVR measured with individual FSVOI in all regions, and thereby showed almost identical between-group comparison results and outperformed the classic methods.


CONCLUSIONS
Customized FreeSurfer-based brain atlas for DARTEL tool is easy to create and useful for the analysis of PET and MR images with high adaptability and reliability for broad research purposes.","Annals of nuclear medicine",32088883,18F-florbetaben,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Accordingly, we aimed to prospectively determine the lowest dose of 64Cu-DOTATATE that facilitates diagnostic-quality scans and evaluated the diagnostic performance and safety in a phase III study of patients with SSTR-expressing NETs. Methods: A dose-ranging study was conducted on 12 patients divided into 3 dose groups (111 MBq [3.0 mCi], 148 MBq [4.0 mCi], and 185 MBq [5.0 mCi] ± 10%) to determine the lowest dose of 64Cu-DOTATATE that produced diagnostic-quality PET/CT images. Using the 64Cu-DOTATATE dose identified in the dose-ranging study, 3 independent nuclear medicine physicians who were masked to all clinical information read PET/CT scans from 21 healthy volunteers and 42 NET-positive patients to determine those with disease or no disease, as well as those with localized versus metastatic status. Masked-reader evaluations were compared with a patient-specific standard of truth, which was established by an independent oncologist who used all previously available pathology, clinical, and conventional imaging data. Diagnostic performance calculated for 64Cu-DOTATATE included sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, and accuracy. Inter- and intrareader reliability, as well as ability to differentiate between localized and metastatic disease, was also determined. Adverse events were recorded from 64Cu-DOTATATE injection through 48 h after injection. Results: The dose-ranging study identified 148 MBq (4.0 mCi) as the optimal dose to obtain diagnostic-quality PET/CT images. After database lock, diagnostic performance from an initial majority read of the 3 independent readers showed a significant 90.9% sensitivity (P = 0.0042) and 96.6% specificity (P < 0.0001) for detecting NETs, which translated to a 100.0% sensitivity and 96.8% specificity after correcting for an initial standard-of-truth misread. Excellent inter- and intrareader reliability, as well as ability to distinguish between localized and metastatic disease, was also noted. No adverse events were related to 64Cu-DOTATATE, and no serious adverse events were observed.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) is a rare subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer with poor prognosis. This study analyzed 18F-FDG PET/CT in PSC and possible correlations with the clinical and genetic findings.


METHODS
Pre-operative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and parameters of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of primary lesion (MTV-P, TLG-P), and combination of primary lesion and metastases (MTV-C, TLG-C) were retrospectively analyzed in 24 patients with PSC confirmed by post-operative pathology. Tumor location, size, TNM stage, serum tumor markers, histopathological features, and mutations were also reviewed. Furthermore, progression-free survival (PFS) of 24 patients was analyzed.


RESULTS
All 24 enrolled patients (20 men; 4 women; age: 62 ± 9 years) had single PSC, including 8 spindle cell carcinomas and 16 pleomorphic carcinomas. Serum levels of tumor markers were found to be abnormally increased sporadically. Six patients had central PSC, and 18 had peripheral PSC (diameter: 41 ± 16 mm). Eighteen lesions were located in the upper lobes of bilateral lungs, and 22 showed necrosis. Five cases were at TNM stage I, 12 at stage II, and 7 at stage III. The primary tumors were FDG avid in the 24 cases, with SUVmax of 17.2 ± 10.6. There were no correlations of SUVmax with tumor location, size, TNM stage, or histopathological subtypes. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression was detected in 21 cases (positivity rate: 87.5%). SUVmax of 17 lesions with PD-L1 expression degree ≥ 50% was obviously higher than that < 50% (P < 0.05). Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutation was found in six cases, and their SUVmax was significantly higher than that without KRAS mutation (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the median PFS of the 24 patients was 14 months, and 12-month and 24-month PFS rates were 55.9% and 27.8%, respectively. Only TLG-P and KRAS mutations of primary lesions were significantly associated with PFS.


CONCLUSIONS
PSC tended to present with intense 18F-FDG accumulation on PET/CT, and SUVmax was useful for assessing PD-L1 and KRAS expression of PSC.

In this second part, we will discuss the role of image-derived quantitative parameters from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in gastric cancer, as both techniques have been shown to be promising and useful tools in the clinical decision making of this disease. We will focus on different aspects including aggressiveness assessment, staging and Lauren type discrimination, prognosis prediction and response evaluation. Although both the number of articles and the patients enrolled in the studies were rather small, there is evidence that quantitative parameters from DCE-MRI such as Ktrans, Ve, Kep and AUC could be promising image-derived surrogate parameters for the management of gastric cancer.

7748,"Development and biological evaluation of[18F]FMN3PA & [18F]FMN3PU for leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in vivo PET imaging.","PURPOSE
Among all genetic mutations of LRRK2, the G2019S mutation is the most commonly associated with the late-onset of Parkinson's disease (PD). Hence, one potential therapeutic approach is to block the hyperactivity of mutated LRRK2 induced by kinase inhibition. To date, only a few LRRK2 kinase inhibitors have been tested for in vivo quantification of target engagement by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, we performed biological evaluations of two radiolabeled kinase inhibitors i.e. [18F]FMN3PA (14) and [18F]FMN3PU for LRRK2 (15).


PROCEDURES
Radiosyntheses of [18F]FMN3PA (14) and [18F]FMN3PU (15) were performed using K[18F]-F-K222 complex in a TRACERlab FXN module and purification was carried out via C18 plus (Sep-Pak) cartridges. In vitro specific binding assays were performed in rat brain striatum and kidney tissues using GNE-0877 as a blocking agent (Ki = 0.7 nM). For in vivo blocking, 3 mg/kg of GNE-0877 was injected 30 min before radiotracer injection via tail vein in wild-type (WT) mice (n = 4). Dynamic scans by PET/CT (Siemens Inveon) were performed in WT mice (n = 3).


RESULTS
Radiofluorinations resulted in radiochemical yields (RCYs) of 25 ± 1.3% (n = 6) ([18F]FMN3PU, 15) and 37 ± 1.6% (n = 6) ([18F]FMN3PA, 14) with ≥96% radiochemical purity (RCP) and a molar activity (MA) of 3.55 ± 1.6 Ci/μmol (131 ± 56 GBq/μmol) for [18F]FMN3PU (15) and 4.57 ± 1.7 Ci/μmol (169 ± 63 GBq/μmol) for [18F]FMN3PA (14), respectively. Saturation assays showed high specific binding for rat brain striatum with Kd 20 ± 1.3 nM ([18F]FMN3PA, 14) and 23.6 ± 4.0 nM ([18F]FMN3PU, 15).

The outcome measure for 11C-osimertinib brain exposure was the total distribution volume (VT). 11C-osimertinib distributed rapidly to the brain, with higher uptake in grey than in white matter. Mean Cmax, Tmax and AUC0-90 min brain/blood ratio were 1.5 (range 1-1.8), 13 min (range 5-30 min), and 3.8 (range 3.3-4.1). Whole brain and white matter VT were 14 mL×cm-3 (range 11-18) and 7 mL×cm-3 (range 5-12). This study in healthy volunteers shows that 11C-osimertinib penetrates the intact blood-brain barrier. The approach used further illustrates the role of molecular imaging in facilitating the development of novel drugs for the treatment of malignancies affecting the brain.","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism",31006308,11C-osimertinib,"11C-labelled osimertinib",EGFRm,"tumor regions",NULL
20517,"Assessment of Suspected Malignancy or Infection in Immunocompromised Patients After Solid Organ Transplantation by [18F]FDG PET/CT and [18F]FDG PET/MRI.","Purpose
To study the value of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) in assessing immunocompromised patients with suspected malignancy or infection.


Methods
[18F]FDG-PET/CT and [18F]FDG-PET/MRI examinations of patients who were immunocompromised after receiving lung, heart, pancreas, kidney, liver, or combined kidney-liver transplants were analyzed in this retrospective study. Patients underwent whole-body hybrid-imaging because of clinical signs of malignancy and/or infection. Findings were assessed by molecular features ([18F]FDG-uptake) and morphological changes. The final diagnosis, which was arrived at after review of clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic analyses and follow-up imaging studies, served as the reference standard.


Results
Altogether, (i) 28 contrast-enhanced [18F]FDG-PET/CT scans (CE-PET/CT), (ii) 33 non-contrast [18F]FDG-PET/CT scans (NC-PET/CT), and (iii) 18 [18F]FDG-PET/MRI scans were included. Additionally, 12/62 patients underwent follow-up PET imaging to rule out vital tumor or metabolic active inflammatory processes. CE-PET/CT exhibited 94.4% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity, 89.5% positive predictive value (PPV), 88.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 89.3% accuracy with regard to the reference standard. NC-PET/CT exhibited 91.3% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity, 91.3% PPV, 80.0% NPV, and 87.9% accuracy. PET/MRI exhibited 88.6% sensitivity, 99.2% specificity, 99.6% PPV, 81.3% NPV, and 94.4% accuracy. Exact McNemar statistical test (one-sided) showed significant difference between the CT-/MR-component alone and the integrated PET/CT and PET/MRI for diagnosis of malignancy or infection (p value < 0.001). Radiation exposure was 4- to 7-fold higher with PET/CT than with PET/MRI.


Conclusion
For immunocompromised patients with clinically unresolved symptoms, to rule out vital tumor manifestations or metabolic active inflammation, [18F]FDG-PET/MRI, CE-[18F]FDG-PET/CT, and NC-[18F]FDG-PET/CT exhibit excellent performance in diagnosing malignancy or infection. The main strength of PET/MRI is its considerably lower level of radiation exposure than that associated with PET/CT.","Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32831964,[18F]FDG-PET/MRI,2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose([18F]FDG),NULL,NULL,NULL

At baseline assessment, 36 TAK patients underwent 18F-FDG PET-CT scan and maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in arteries ≥ 1.3 was predictive for clinical disease activity. Thirty-two TAK patients were then followed-up for a median 83.5 months. Twenty-three (71.9%) patients developed clinical relapses and new arterial lesions were observed in 14 (43.8%) cases. Disease relapses [85.0% vs. 50.0%, p = 0.049; odds ratio (OR): 5.667; 95% confidence interval (95 CI): 1.067-30.085] and the need for changing immunosuppressive therapy (85.0% vs. 41.7%, p = 0.018; OR: 7.933; 95CI: 1.478-42.581) were more frequently found in patients with SUVmax ≥ 1.3 at baseline compared with those presenting SUVmax < 1.3. No associations were found between SUVmax ≥ or < 1.3 in large arteries at baseline and the development of ischemic events, sustained remission or new angiographic lesions. In multivariate analysis, associations between baseline SUVmax ≥ 1.3 and disease relapses were not independent (hazard ratio: 1.07; 95 CI 0.39-2.92; p = 0.892). In conclusion, arterial SUVmax is marginally associated with disease relapses and with the need to change therapy in TAK. 18F-FDG uptake in large arteries is not associated with the development of new arterial lesions in TAK.","Rheumatology international",32200427,18F-FDG,1.478-42.581),TAK,NULL,SUVmax ≥

However, how the ceramide metabolism changes over time in AD, in vivo, remains unknown. Distribution and metabolism of [18F]F-HPA-12, a radio-fluorinated version of the ceramide analog N-(3-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-3-phenylpropyl) dodecanamide, was investigated in the brain of AD transgenic mouse models (FAD) on an APOE4 or APOE3 genetic background, by positron emission tomography and by gamma counter. We found that FAD mice displayed a higher uptake of [18F]F-HPA-12 in the brain, independently from the APOE4 or APOE3 genetic background. FAD mice could be distinguished from littermate control animals with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 87.5%, by gamma counter measurements. Metabolic analysis of [18F]F-HPA-12 in the brain suggested that the tracer is degraded less efficiently in the FAD mice. Furthermore, the radioactive signal registered in the hippocampus correlated with an increase of Cer d18:1/20:2 levels measured in the same brain region by mass spectrometry. Our data gives additional proof that ceramide metabolism is different in FAD mice compared to controls.

33988,"Evaluation of Dosimetry, Quantitative Methods, and Test-Retest Variability of 18F-PI-2620 PET for the Assessment of Tau Deposits in the Human Brain.","18F-PI-2620 is a next-generation tau PET tracer that has demonstrated ability to image the spatial distribution of suspected tau pathology. The objective of this study was to assess the tracer biodistribution, dosimetry, and quantitative methods of 18F-PI-2620 in the human brain. Full kinetic modeling to quantify tau load was investigated. Noninvasive kinetic modeling and semiquantitative methods were evaluated against the full tracer kinetics. Finally, the reproducibility of PET measurements from test and retest scans was assessed. Methods: Three healthy controls (HCs) and 4 Alzheimer disease (AD) subjects underwent 2 dynamic PET scans, including arterial sampling. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) was estimated using full tracer kinetics (reversible 2-tissue-compartment [2TC] model and Logan graphical analysis [LGA]) and noninvasive kinetic models (noninvasive LGA [NI-LGA] and the multilinear reference tissue model [MRTM2]). SUV ratio (SUVR) was determined at different imaging windows after injection. The correlation between DVR and SUVR, effect size (Cohen's d), and test-retest variability (TRV) were evaluated. Additionally, 6 HCs received 1 tracer administration and underwent whole-body PET for dosimetry calculation. Organ doses and the whole-body effective dose were calculated using OLINDA 2.0. Results: A strong correlation was found across different kinetic models (R 2 > 0.97) and between DVR(2TC) and SUVR between 30 and 90 min, with an R 2 of more than 0.95. Secular equilibrium was reached at around 40 min after injection in most regions and subjects. TRV and effect size for SUVR across different regions were similar at 30-60 min (TRV, 3.8%; Cohen's d, 3.80), 45-75 min (TRV, 4.3%; Cohen's d, 3.77) and 60-90 min (TRV, 4.9%; Cohen's d, 3.73) and increased at later time points. Elimination was via the hepatobiliary and urinary systems. The whole-body effective dose was 33.3 ± 2.1 μSv/MBq for an adult female and 33.1 ± 1.4 μSv/MBq for an adult male, with a 1.5-h urinary bladder voiding interval. Conclusion: 18F-PI-2620 exhibits fast kinetics, suitable dosimetry, and low TRV. DVR measured using the 2TC model with arterial sampling correlated strongly with DVR measured by NI-LGA, MRTM2, and SUVR. SUVR can be used for 18F-PI-2620 PET quantification of tau deposits, avoiding arterial blood sampling.

71267,"Preclinical comparison of four [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 isomers: influence of the stereoconfiguration on pharmacokinetics.","INTRODUCTION
Radiohybrid (rh) ligands, a novel class of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiopharmaceuticals, can be labeled either with [18F]fluorine via isotopic exchange or with radiometals (such as [68Ga]Gallium, [177Lu]Lutetium, [225Ac]Actinium). Among these, [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 has recently entered clinical assessment.


AIM
Since [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 is composed of four stereoisomers ([18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1, -7.2, -7.3 and -7.4), we initiated a preclinical selection process to identify the isomer with the most favorable pharmacokinetics for further clinical investigation.


METHODS
A synthetic protocol for enantiopure [19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7 isomers has been developed. The comparative evaluation of the four isomers comprised human serum albumin binding, lipophilicity, IC50, internalization and classical biodistribution studies and competition experiments in LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 SCID mice. In addition, a radio high-performance liquid chromatography-based method was developed allowing quantitative, intraindividual comparison of [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1 to -7.4 in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice.


RESULTS
Cell studies revealed high PSMA affinity and internalization for [18/19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.2, -7.3 and -7.4, whereas [18/19F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.1 showed approximately twofold lower values. Although the biodistribution profile obtained was typical of PSMA inhibitors, it did not allow for selection of a lead candidate for clinical studies. Thus, an intraindividual comparison of all four isomers in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice was carried out by injection of a diastereomeric mixture, followed by analysis of the differential uptake and excretion pattern of each isomer. Based on its high tumor accumulation and low uptake in blood, liver and kidneys, [18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.3 was identified as the preferred isomer and transferred into clinical studies.


CONCLUSION
[18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.3 has been selected as a lead compound for clinical development of a [18F]rhPSMA-based candidate. The intraindividual differential uptake and excretion analysis in vivo allowed for an accurate comparison and assessment of radiopharmaceuticals.","EJNMMI research",33284394,[18F]rhPSMA-based,"[18F, natGa]rhPSMA-7.3",PSMA,NULL,"LNCaP tumor-bearing CB-17 SCID mice"
19818,"[18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide PET imaging: biodistribution, dosimetry and first comparison with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE in neuroendocrine tumour patients.","PURPOSE
The widespread use of gallium-68-labelled somatostatin analogue (SSA) PET, the current standard for somatostatin receptor (SSTR) imaging, is limited by practical and economic challenges that could be overcome by a fluorine-18-labelled alternative, such as the recently introduced [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide ([18F]AlF-OC). This prospective trial aimed to evaluate safety, dosimetry, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and lesion targeting of [18F]AlF-OC and perform the first comparison with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE in neuroendocrine tumour (NET) patients.


METHODS
Six healthy volunteers and six NET patients with a previous clinical [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE PET were injected with an IV bolus of 4 MBq/kg [18F]AlF-OC. Healthy volunteers underwent serial whole-body PET scans from time of tracer injection up to 90 min post-injection, with an additional PET/CT at 150 and 300 min post-injection. In patients, a 45-min dynamic PET was acquired and three whole-body PET scans at 60, 90 and 180 min post-injection. Absorbed organ doses and effective doses were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. Normal organ uptake (SUVmean) and tumour lesion uptake (SUVmax and tumour-to-background ratio (TBR)) were measured. A lesion-by-lesion analysis was performed and the detection ratio (DR), defined as the fraction of detected lesions was determined for each tracer.


RESULTS
[18F]AlF-OC administration was safe and well tolerated. The highest dose was received by the spleen (0.159 ± 0.062 mGy/MBq), followed by the urinary bladder wall (0.135 ± 0.046 mGy/mBq) and the kidneys (0.070 ± 0.018 mGy/MBq), in accordance with the expected SSTR-specific uptake in the spleen and renal excretion of the tracer. The effective dose was 22.4 ± 4.4 μSv/MBq. The physiologic uptake pattern of [18F]AlF-OC was comparable to [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. Mean tumour SUVmax was lower for [18F]AlF-OC (12.3 ± 6.5 at 2 h post-injection vs. 18.3 ± 9.5; p = 0.03). However, no significant differences were found in TBR (9.8 ± 6.7 at 2 h post-injection vs. 13.6 ± 11.8; p = 0.35). DR was high and comparable for both tracers (86.0% for [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE vs. 90.1% for [18F]AlF-OC at 2 h post-injection; p = 0.68).


CONCLUSION
[18F]AlF-OC shows favourable kinetic and imaging characteristics in patients that warrant further head-to-head comparison to validate [18F]AlF-OC as a fluorine-18-labelled alternative for gallium-68-labelled SSA clinical PET.

[11C]DPA-713 showed enhanced uptake in affected joints of RA patients, with tracer uptake levels corresponding to clinical presence and severity of arthritis. The optimal quantitative model for assessment of [11C]DPA-713 uptake was the irreversible two tissue compartment model (2T3k). Both Ki and standardized uptake value (SUV) correlated with the presence of arthritis in RA patients.

It is urgent to find an efficient and biocompatible liver targeted delivery system. This study focused on the liver targeting properties of erythrocyte ghosts and its possible mechanism. Herein, we optimized conditions to fabricate human and mouse erythrocyte ghosts with sufficient room capable of incorporating various model substances. Erythrocyte ghosts are biocompatible cargo carriers because it is derived from autologous red blood cells (RBCs), and the cell size, zeta potential, and biconcave-disk shape of the ghosts were consistent with those of RBCs. An in vivo imaging system and positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging showed that the ghosts were captured mainly in the liver by intravenous injection of fluorescence or 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-labelled ghosts into mice. In contrast, the main concentration of naked octreotide was trapped in the lungs while naked 18F-FDG was trapped in the heart. However, the concentration of cargo-loaded ghosts decreased significantly in the liver in macrophage-depleted mice. Accordingly, in vitro experiments showed that higher phosphatidylserine exposure was observed in the ghosts (38.9 %) compared to normal erythrocytes (0.69 %), and the phagocytic activity of the macrophage RAW 264.7. on the ghosts was significantly higher than that of normal erythrocytes (p < 0.001). Together they indicate that erythrocyte ghosts show liver targeting properties, and possibly owing to macrophage phagocytosis.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the TIGAR expression and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of 18F-FDG PET/CT on survival for patients with clear cell RCC. Methods: A total of 62 patients with confirmed clear cell RCC were included in this retrospective study. The TIGAR expression of tumors were determined through immunohistochemistry staining. The SUVmax of clear cell RCC lesions were assessed using 18F-FDG PET/CT. The impact of TIGAR expression and SUVmax on overall survival was evaluated by the Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: Increased TIGAR staining was associated in clear cell RCC patients with older age, venous tumor thrombus, or increased SUVmax. A positive correlation was found between TIGAR expression and SUVmax in patients (r=0.396, P=0.001). Patients with positive TIGAR expression had a decreased overall survival time than those with negative TIGAR expression. The overall survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high SUVmax (>5.25) compared with those with low SUVmax (≤5.25). SUVmax and Fuhrman grade were identified as independent prognostic factors in clear cell RCC. Patients with high SUVmax (>5.25) and positive TIGAR expression were associated with a worse disease prognosis. Conclusion: The expression of TIGAR is significantly correlated with SUVmax in clear cell RCC.

Temperature-sensitive radiopharmaceutical precursors require lower reaction temperatures (<100 °C) during nucleophilic radiofluorination in order to avoid compound thermolysis, often resulting in sub-optimal radiochemical yields (RCYs). To facilitate nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) of nucleofuges commonly used in radiofluorination (e.g., nitro group), we explored the use of Lewis acids as nucleophilic activators to accelerate [18F]fluoride incorporation at lower temperatures, and thereby increasing RCYs for thermolabile activated precursors. Lewis acid-assisted radiofluorination was exemplified on the temperature-sensitive compound 1-(4-(4-morpholino-7-neopentyl-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)phenyl)-3-(6-nitropyridin-3-yl)urea (MN3PU, compound 3) targeting leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), an important target in the study of Parkinson's disease and various cancers.


METHODS

Metabolic information obtained through 18F-flurodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) is used to evaluate malignancy by calculating the glucose uptake rate, and these parameters play important roles in determining the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of immune-related markers in tumor tissue reflects the immune status in the tumor microenvironment. However, there is lack of reports on the association between metabolic variables and intra-tumor immune markers. Herein, we investigate the correlation between metabolic status on 18F-FDG PET/CT and intra-tumor immunomarkers' expression in NSCLC patients.


METHODS
From April 2008 to August 2014, 763 patients were enrolled in the analysis to investigate the role of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in lung cancer. One hundred twenty-two tumor specimens were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) to intra-tumor immune cells and programmed death protein ligand 1(PD-L1) expression on tumor cells. The correlation between metabolic variables and the expression of tissue immune markers were analyzed.


RESULTS
SUVmax values have significant variations in different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) statuses (wild type vs mutant type), high/low neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) groups, and high/low platelets-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.003, respectively).

14527,"18F- based Quantification of the Osteogenic Potential of hMSCs.","In bone tissue engineering, there is a constant need to design new methods for promoting in vitro osteogenic differentiation. Consequently, there is a strong demand for fast, effective and reliable methods to track and quantify osteogenesis in vitro. In this study, we used the radiopharmacon fluorine-18 (18F) to evaluate the amount of hydroxylapatite produced by mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in a monolayer cell culture in vitro. The hydroxylapatite bound tracer was evaluated using µ-positron emission tomography (µ-PET) scanning and activimeter analysis. It was therefore possible to determine the amount of synthesized mineral and thus to conclude the osteogenic potential of the cells. A Student's t-test revealed a highly significant difference regarding tracer uptake between the osteogenic group and the corresponding control group (µ-PET p = 0.043; activimeter analysis p = 0.012). This tracer uptake showed a highly significant correlation with the gold standard of quantitative Alizarin Red staining (ARS) (r2 = 0.86) as well as with the absolute calcium content detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (r2 = 0.81). The results showed that 18F labeling is a novel method to prove and quantify hydroxyapatite content in MSC monolayer cultures. The mineral layer remains intact for further analysis. This non-destructive in vitro method can be used to rapidly investigate bone tissue engineering strategies in terms of hydroxylapatite production, and could therefore accelerate the process of implementing new strategies in clinical practice.","International journal of molecular sciences",33080871,18F,(18F,NULL,NULL,MSCs

47446,"Immuno-PET imaging for non-invasive assessment of cetuximab accumulation in non-small cell lung cancer.","BACKGROUNDS
Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been established as a valid therapeutic target of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical benefit of cetuximab as an EGFR-targeting drug is still controversial, partially due to the lack of effective means to identify suitable patients. This study aimed to investigate the potential of radiolabeled cetuximab as a non-invasive tool to predict cetuximab accumulation in NSCLC tumor xenografts with varying EGFR expression levels.


METHODS
The NSCLC tumors in model mice were subjected to in vivo biodistribution study and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging 48 h after injection of either 111In- or 64Cu-labeled cetuximab. The EGFR expression levels of NSCLC tumors were determined by ex vivo immunoblotting.


RESULTS
We found that tumors with high EGFR expression had significantly higher [111In]In-DOTA-cetuximab accumulation than tumors with moderate to low EGFR expression (P < 0.05). Strong correlations were found between [111In]In-DOTA-cetuximab tumor uptake and EGFR expression level (r = 0.893), and between [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-cetuximab tumor uptake with EGFR expression level (r = 0.915). PET imaging with [64Cu]Cu-DOTA-cetuximab allowed clear visualization of tumors.


CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that this immuno-PET imaging can be clinically translated as a tool to predict cetuximab accumulation in NSCLC cancer patients prior to cetuximab therapy.","BMC cancer",31651282,[64Cu]Cu-DOTA-cetuximab,"64Cu-labeled cetuximab",EGFR,NULL,NULL
20752,"Initial Evaluation of AF78: a Rationally Designed Fluorine-18-Labelled PET Radiotracer Targeting Norepinephrine Transporter.","PURPOSE
Taking full advantage of positron emission tomography (PET) technology, fluorine-18-labelled radiotracers targeting norepinephrine transporter (NET) have potential applications in the diagnosis and assessment of cardiac sympathetic nerve conditions as well as the delineation of neuroendocrine tumours. However, to date, none have been used clinically. Drawbacks of currently reported radiotracers include suboptimal kinetics and challenging radiolabelling procedures.


PROCEDURES
We developed a novel fluorine-18-labelled radiotracer targeting NET, AF78, with efficient one-step radiolabelling based on the phenethylguanidine structure. Radiosynthesis of AF78 was undertaken, followed by validation in cell uptake studies, autoradiography, and in vivo imaging in rats.


RESULTS
[18F]AF78 was successfully synthesized with 27.9 ± 3.1 % radiochemical yield, > 97 % radiochemical purity and > 53.8 GBq/mmol molar activity. Cell uptake studies demonstrated essentially identical affinity for NET as norepinephrine and meta-iodobenzylgaunidine. Both ex vivo autoradiography and in vivo imaging in rats showed homogeneous and specific cardiac uptake.


CONCLUSIONS
The new PET radiotracer [18F]AF78 demonstrated high affinity for NET and favourable biodistribution in rats. A structure-activity relationship between radiotracer structures and affinity for NET was revealed, which may serve as the basis for the further design of NET targeting radiotracers with favourable features.","Molecular imaging and biology",31332629,[18F]AF78,"fluorine-18-labelled radiotracer",NULL,NET,NULL

Accurate differentiation between malignant and benign changes in soft tissue and bone lesions is essential for the prevention of unnecessary biopsies and surgical resection. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge and a standard diagnosis modality is urgently needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT-derived parameters to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and bone sarcoma (BS) from benign lesions.


METHODS
Patients who had undergone pre-treatment 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging and subsequent pathological diagnoses to confirm malignant (STS and BS, n = 37) and benign (n = 33) soft tissue and bone lesions were retrospectively reviewed. The tumor size, PET and low-dose CT visual characteristics, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and heterogeneous factor (HF) of each lesion were measured. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the significant risk factors to distinguish sarcoma from benign lesions. To establish a regression model based on independent risk factors, and the receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs) of individual parameters and their combination were plotted and compared. Conventional imaging scans were re-analyzed, and the diagnostic performance compared with the regression model.


RESULTS
Univariate analysis results revealed that tumor size, SUVmax, MTV, TLG, and HF of 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in the STS and BS group were all higher than in the benign lesions group (all P values were < 0.01). The differences in the visual characteristics between the two groups were also all statistically significant (P < 0.05). However, the multivariate regression model only included SUVmax and HF as independent risk factors, for which the odds ratios were 1.135 (95%CI: 1.026 ~ 1.256, P = 0.014) and 7.869 (95%CI: 2.119 ~ 29.230, P = 0.002), respectively. The regression model was constructed using the following expression: Logit (P) = - 2.461 + 0.127SUVmax + 2.063HF. The area under the ROC was 0.860, which was higher than SUVmax (0.744) and HF (0.790). The diagnostic performance of the regression model was superior to those of individual parameters and conventional imaging.

The regression model including SUVmax and HF based on 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging may be useful for differentiating STS and BS from benign lesions.","BMC medical imaging",32711449,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",STS,ROC,NULL

Here, we report on the application of pH-sensitive pharmaceutical grade CMC-based nanoparticles (NP) for white blood cells (WBC) PET imaging. In this context and as an alternative to 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT labeling, the use of 68Ga3+ as PET radionuclide was investigated since, at early time points, it could provide the greater spatial resolution and patient convenience of PET tomography over SPECT clinical practices. Two operator-friendly kit-type formulations were compared, with the intention of radiolabeling within a short time (10 min), under mild conditions (physiological pH, room temperature) and in agreement with the actual clinically applied guidelines. NP were labeled by directly using 68Ga3+ eluted in HCL 0.05 N, from hospital suited 68Ge/68Ga generator and in absence of chelator. The first kit type approach involved the application of 68Ga3+ as an ionotropic gelation agent for in-situ forming NP. The second kit type approach concerned the re-hydration of a proper freeze-dried injectable NP powder. pH-sensitive NP with 250 nm average diameter and 80% labeling efficacy were obtained. The NP dispersant medium, including a cryoprotective agent, was modulated in order to optimize the Zeta potential value (-18 mV), minimize the NP interaction with serum proteins and guarantee a physiological environment for WBC during NP incubation. Time-dependent WBC radiolabeling was correlated to NP uptake by using both confocal and FT-IR microscopies.

64260,"The relationship between cholecystokinin secretion and pancreatic [11C]methionine uptake in patients after partial pancreaticoduodenectomy.","OBJECTIVE
The pancreatic uptake of [11C]methionine ([11C]MET) is associated with beta-cell function and insulin secretion, but [11C]MET uptake and its relationship with exocrine pancreatic performance are less well studied. The postprandial release of cholecystokinin (CCK) depends on gastric emptying velocity and triggers exocrine pancreas secretion. Therefore, we assumed that high postprandial CCK concentrations stimulate the uptake of [11C]MET in the residual pancreas following pancreaticoduodenectomy.


METHODS
Nineteen tumor-free patients after pancreaticoduodenectomy (median age: 64; 25/75 quantile: 56-67 years); ten males, nine females and ten healthy controls (median age: 24; 25/75 quantile: 23.8-26 years) were given a mixed meal. Plasma CCK, insulin and glucose concentrations were measured before and at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 150 and 180 min after ingestion. Simultaneously, 800 MBq of [11C]MET were administered and the activity [maximum tissue standardized uptake values (SUVmax)] over the pancreas was measured using PET-CT at 15, 30 and 60 min after injection.


RESULTS
Integrated CCK (AUC30) correlated with SUVmax (AUC60, R2 = 0.45, p value = 0.0013). Multivariate analysis revealed postprandial insulin (AUC60) and CCK concentrations and young age as significant independent predictors of [11C] methionine uptake.


CONCLUSION
The association between CCK concentrations and pancreatic [11C]MET uptake might indicate a causal relationship. Further research should assess whether [11C]MET uptake could serve as a less invasive tool to assess exocrine pancreas activity.","Annals of nuclear medicine",32654031,[11C]MET,"[11C] methionine",PET-CT,NULL,NULL

The goal of this study is to develop an efficient, reproducible, and straightforward method to prepare a fluorine-18 labeled CXCR4 ligand. 6-[18F]Fluoronicotinic acid-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester (6-[18F]FPy-TFP) and nicotinic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (6-[18F]SFPy) have been prepared using 'fluorination on the Sep-Pak' method. Conjugation of 6-[18F]SFPy or 6-[18F]FPy-TFP with the alpha-amino group at the N terminus of the protected T140 precursor followed by deprotection, yielded the final product 6-[18F]FPy-T140.

25153,"Synthesis and evaluation of N-isopropyl-p-[11C]methylamphetamine as a novel cerebral blood flow tracer for positron emission tomography.","INTRODUCTION
Increases in fasting plasma glucose (PG) levels lead to a decrease in 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) uptake in the normal brain, especially in the precuneus, resulting in an Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like uptake pattern. Therefore, patients with higher PG levels, such as those with diabetes, can be erroneously diagnosed with AD when positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is done using [18F]FDG, due to reduced uptake of [18F]FDG in the precuneus. To help avoid an erroneous diagnosis of AD due to differences in glucose metabolism, evaluating cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the brain is useful. However, current techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [15O]H2O PET have limitations regarding early diagnosis of AD because the images they produce are of low resolution. Here, we developed a novel CBF PET tracer that may be more useful than [18F]FDG for diagnosis of AD.


METHODS
We synthesized and evaluated N-isopropyl-p-[11C]methylamphetamine ([11C]4) as a carbon-11-labeled analogue of the standard CBF SPECT tracer N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine. Fundamental biological evaluations such as biodistribution, peripheral metabolism in mice, and brain kinetics of [11C]4 in non-human primates with PET with successive measurement of [15O]H2O were performed.


RESULTS
[11C]4 was synthesized by methylation of the corresponding tributyltin precursor (2) with [11C]MeI in a palladium-promoted Stille cross-coupling reaction. The brain uptake of [11C]4 in mice peaked at 5-15 min after injection and then promptly decreased. Most radioactivity in the brain was detected in the unchanged form, although in the periphery, [11C]4 was rapidly metabolized to hydrophilic components. Acetazolamide (AZM) treatment significantly increased the brain uptake of [11C]4 without affecting the blood levels of radioactivity in mice. Preliminary kinetics analysis showed that the K1 of [11C]4 reflected regional CBF in a vehicle-treated monkey, but that the K1 did not reflect CBF in higher flow regions after AZM loading.


CONCLUSION
[11C]4 is a potential novel CBF PET tracer. Further validation studies are needed before [11C]4 can be used in humans.","EJNMMI research",33000345,[11C]4,"carbon-11-labeled analogue",CBF,NULL,NULL

PSMA imaging is frequently used for monitoring of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in prostate cancer. In a previous study, [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 exhibited favorable properties for tumor localization after biochemical recurrence. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the performance of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 under ADT.


PROCEDURES
We examined the performance of [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 in 70 patients (first cohort) with increasing or detectable PSA values under ADT (PSA < 2 ng/ml for 21/70 patients). We further analyzed 58 independent patients with PSA levels < 2 ng/ml under ADT, who were imaged with [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL (second cohort). Finally, we compared detection rates between [18F]-JK-PSMA-7, [68Ga]PSMA-11, and [18F]DCFPyL.


RESULTS
In the first cohort, we detected [18F]-JK-PSMA-7-positive lesions in 63/70 patients. In patients with PSA levels ≥ 2 ng/ml, the detection rate was 100 % (49/49). In patients with PSA < 2 ng/ml, the detection rate was significantly lower (66.7 %, 14/21, p = 9.7 × 10-5) and dropped from 85.7 % (12/14, PSA levels between 0.3 and 2.0 ng/ml) to 28.6 % (2/7) for PSA levels < 0.3 ng/ml (p = 1.73 × 10-2). In the second cohort (PSA < 2 ng/ml), the detection rate was 79.3 % (46/58) for [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL. Again, the detection rate was significantly higher (p = 1.1 × 10-2) for patients with PSA levels between 0.3 and 2.0 ng/ml (87.0 %, 40/46) relative to those with PSA levels < 0.3 ng/ml (50 %, 6/12). No significant difference was found between [18F]-JK-PSMA-7 and [68Ga]PSMA-11 or [18F]DCFPyL in patients with PSA levels < 2 ng/ml (p = 0.4295).


CONCLUSION
[18F]-JK-PSMA-7 PET showed a high detection rate in patients with PSA levels ≥ 0.3 ng/ml under ADT.

METHODS
In this prospective study, patients underwent both [18F]F-FDG and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi PET/CT scans 60 min post-injection (p.i.). Dosimetry studies were conducted in three patients using [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi serial time-point imaging. The absorbed dose was calculated using OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. Quantification of the uptake of the tracers was assessed using standardized uptake values corrected for lean body mass (SUL).


RESULTS
Fifty-four patients (mean age; 48.4 years) with 14 types of cancers involving 37% breast, 24% lung, 7.4% head and neck (H&N), and remaining 31.6% patients with other histologies were evaluated prospectively. Physiological uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi was observed in the liver, kidneys, pancreas, heart contents, and to a lesser extent in the lacrimals, oral mucosa, salivary glands, and thyroid glands. Uptake in the target lesions on [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi scan was initiated at 10 min, and no additional lesions were detected in the delayed acquisition time points. The pancreas was the organ with the highest absorbed dose (5.46E-02 mSv/MBq). While the patient-based comparison between the radiotracers revealed complete concordance in the detection of primary, pleural thickening, bone and liver metastases, and second primary malignancy, discordant findings were observed in the detection of lymph node (7.5%), lung nodules (5.6%), and brain metastases (2%). According to the site of primary disease, patients with H&N cancers demonstrated the highest SULpeak and average (avg) values on [68Ga]Ga-DOTA.SA-FAPi which was similar to the values of [18F]F-FDG [(SULpeak: 15.4 vs. 14.2; P-0.680) (SULavg: 8.3 vs. 7.9; P-0.783)].

Angiogenesis plays an important role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) progression. This pilot study was designed to compare the distribution of 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD PET/CT for imaging αvβ3 integrins involved in tumor angiogenesis to 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with HNSCC.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Ten patients (aged 58.4 ± 8.3 years [range, 44-73 years], 6 males, 4 females) with a total of 11 HNSCC were prospectively enrolled. Activity mapping and standard uptake values (SUV) from both 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD and 18F-FDG PET/CT scans were recorded for primary tumor and compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The relation between the SUV of both tracers was assessed using the Spearman correlation.


RESULTS
All HNSCC tumors were visible with both tracers. Quantitative analysis showed higher 18F-FDG SUVmax in comparison to 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD (14.0 ± 6.1 versus 3.9 ± 1.1 g/mL, p = 0.0017) and SUVmean (8.2 ± 3.1 versus 2.0 ± 0.8 g/mL, p = 0.0017). Both 18F-FDG and 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD uptakes were neither correlated with grade, HPV status nor p16 protein expression (p ≥ 0.17).


CONCLUSION
All HNSCC tumors were detected with both tracers with higher uptake with 18F-FDG, however. 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD has a different spatial distribution than 18F-FDG bringing different tumor information.

Forest plots were generated for sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT, WB-MRI, and whole-body diffusion-weighted imaging (WB-DWI). Summary receiver operating characteristic plots were created.


RESULTS
The 4 studies meeting inclusion criteria had a total of 564 patients and 559 lesions, 233 of which were metastases. In studies of 18F-FDG PET/CT, the pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54-0.95) and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96), respectively. For WB-MRI, pooled sensitivity was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.18-1.00) and pooled specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95). Pooled sensitivity and specificity for WB-DWI were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.46-0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79-0.96), respectively. There was no statistical difference between the diagnostic odds ratio of WB-MRI and WB-DWI compared with that of PET/CT (p = 0.186 for WB-DWI; p = 0.638 for WB-MRI).


CONCLUSION
WB-MRI and DWI are radiation-free alternatives with comparable diagnostic performance to 18F-FDG PET/CT for M staging of NSCLC.


KEY POINTS
• Whole-body MRI with or without diffusion-weighted imaging has a high accuracy for the diagnostic evaluation of metastases in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. • Whole-body MRI may be used as a non-invasive and radiation-free alternative to positron emission tomography with CT with similar diagnostic performance.","European radiology",32125513,18F-fluorodeoxyglucose,"18F-FDG PET/CT",CT,NULL,NULL
1329,"Emerging F-18-Labelled PET Myocardial Perfusion Tracers.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW
PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is an established modality for the evaluation of ischemic heart disease and quantitation of myocardial blood flow (MBF). New F-18-labelled radiopharmaceuticals have been recently developed to overcome some of the limitations of currently used tracers such as the need of an on-site cyclotron. The characteristics of the new tracers and the clinical results obtained so far will be reviewed.


RECENT FINDINGS
Most of the interest in the field of 18F-labelled radiotracers for PET MPI has been concentrated on MC-1 inhibitors, the prototype of which is 18F-flurpiridaz. It was shown in experimental and clinical reports that these radiotracers allow good quality rest/stress MPI studies and a reliable quantitation of MBF. Recent evidence suggests that PET MPI with 18F-flurpiridaz may provide a superior diagnostic accuracy for obstructive CAD even if a large comparative clinical trial with SPECT is still ongoing.","Current cardiology reports",32772178,18F-flurpiridaz,"18F-labelled radiotracers",NULL,NULL,NULL
14816,"In vivo Characterization of Four 18F-Labeled S1PR1 Tracers for Neuroinflammation.","PURPOSE
The sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) is an important biomarker for imaging inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). Herein, we report our recent evaluation of four 18F-labeled S1PR1 tracers (18F-TZ43113, 18F-TZ35104, 18F-TZ4877, and 18F-TZ4881) in a rat model of multiple sclerosis (MS).


PROCEDURES
MicroPET studies of each tracer's uptake and kinetics were performed in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS to quantify upregulated S1PR1 expression in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats. Western blot analysis was conducted to confirm the differences in the expression of S1PR1 protein level between EAE and sham rats. Radiometabolite analysis was performed for the most promising candidate in rats.


RESULTS
All four S1PR1 tracers detected increased S1PR1 levels in response to neuroinflammation in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats, which was supported by western blot results. The ranked order of tracer uptake in rat spinal cord was 18F-TZ4877 > 18F-TZ4881 > 18F-TZ35104 > 18F-TZ43113. 18F-TZ4877 had the highest uptake of the four tracers and showed good kinetic modeling fits in rat spinal cord using an image-based method of arterial blood input function. Radiometabolite analysis of 18F-TZ4877 showed good in vivo stability with no major radiometabolite accumulation in the rat brain.


CONCLUSION
Among these four new PET tracers, 18F-TZ4877 showed the most favorable profile for assessing S1PR1 expression in the EAE rat model of MS. Further characterization of these radiotracers in other models of neuroinflammation is warranted to identify a promising 18F-labeled tracer for imaging S1PR1 in vivo.","Molecular imaging and biology",32602083,18F-TZ4877,"18F-labeled tracer",S1PR1,NULL,NULL

The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [11C]-(+)-PHNO, an agonist that binds with high affinity to both D2 and D3 receptors, has been used to estimate relative receptor subtype occupancy by drugs based on a priori knowledge of regional variation in the expression of D2 and D3 receptors. The objective of this work was to use a data-driven independent component analysis (ICA) of receptor blocking scans to separate D2-and D3-related signal in [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding data in order to improve the precision of subtype specific measurements of binding and occupancy. Eight healthy volunteers underwent [11C]-(+)-PHNO PET scans at baseline and at two time points following administration of the D3-preferring antagonist ABT-728 (150-1000 ​mg). Parametric binding potential (BPND) images were analyzed as four-dimensional image series using ICA to extract two independent sources of variation in [11C]-(+)-PHNO BPND. Spatial source maps for each component were consistent with respective regional patterns of D2-and D3-related binding. ICA-derived occupancy estimates from each component were similar to D2-and D3-specific occupancy estimated from a region-based approach (intraclass correlation coefficients ​> ​0.95). ICA-derived estimates of D3 receptor occupancy improved quality of fit to a single site binding model. Furthermore, ICA-derived estimates of the regional fraction of [11C]-(+)-PHNO binding related to D3 receptors was generated for each subject and values showed good agreement with region-based model estimates and prior literature values.

The objective of this study is to assess the ability of a prototype semiconductor-based silicon/cadmium telluride (Si/CdTe) Compton camera to simultaneously image the distributions of technetium (99mTc)-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (141 keV emission) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) (511 keV emission) injected into a human volunteer. 99mTc-DMSA and 18F-FDG were injected intravenously into a 25-year-old male volunteer. The distributions of 99mTc-DMSA and 18F-FDG were simultaneously made visible by setting a specified energy window for each radioisotope. The images of these radiopharmaceuticals acquired using the prototype Compton camera were superimposed onto computed tomography images for reference. The reconstructed image showed that 99mTc-DMSA had accumulated in both kidneys, which is consistent with the well-known diagnostic distribution determined by clinical imaging via single-photon emission computed tomography. In the 18F-FDG image, there is broad distribution around the liver and kidneys, which was expected based on routine clinical positron emission tomography imaging. The current study demonstrated for the first time that the Si/CdTe Compton camera was capable of simultaneously imaging the distributions of two radiopharmaceuticals, 99mTc-DMSA and 18F-FDG, in a human body.

However, 2-[18F]F-PABA is rapidly N-acetylated and eliminated, and in an attempt to improve radiotracer accumulation in bacteria we adopted a prodrug strategy in which the acid was protected by an ester and the amine was replaced with a nitro group. Metabolite analysis indicated that the nitro group of ethyl 2-[18F]fluoro-4-nitrobenzoate (2-[18F]F-ENB) is converted to the corresponding amine by bacteria-specific nitroreductases while the ester is hydrolyzed in vivo into the acid. PET/CT imaging of 2-[18F]F-ENB and the corresponding acid 2-[18F]F-NB in a rat soft tissue infection model demonstrated colocalization of the radiotracer with the bioluminescent signal arising from S. aureus Xen29, and demonstrated that the tracer could differentiate S. aureus infection from sterile inflammation. Significantly, the accumulation of both 2-[18F]F-ENB and 2-[18F]F-NB at the site of infection was 17-fold higher than at the site of sterile inflammation compared to 8-fold difference observed for 2-[18F]F-PABA, supporting the proposal that the active radiotracer in vivo is 2-[18F]F-NB.

18760,"Synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of 11C-O-methylated arylpiperazines as potential serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist radiotracers.","BACKGROUND
Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors are implicated in the pathogenesis of several psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders motivating the development of suitable radiotracers for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging. The gold standard PET imaging agent for this target is [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635, labeled via a technically challenging multi-step reaction that has limited its widespread use. While several antagonist and agonist-based PET radiotracers for 5-HT 1A receptors have been developed, their clinical translation has been hindered by methodological challenges and/or and non-specific binding. As a result, there is continued interest in the development of new and more selective 5-HT1A PET tracers having a relatively easier and reliable radiosynthesis process for routine production and with favorable metabolism to facilitate tracer-kinetic modeling. The purpose of the current study was to develop and characterize a radioligand with suitable characteristics for imaging 5-HT1A receptors in the brain. The current study reports the in vitro characterization and radiosyntheses of three candidate 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, DF-100 (1), DF-300 (2) and DF-400 (3), to explore their suitability as potential PET radiotracers.


RESULTS
Syntheses of 1-3 and corresponding precursors for radiolabeling were achieved from isonicotinic, picolinic acid or picolino nitrile. In vitro binding studies demonstrated nanomolar affinity of the compounds for 5-HT1A receptors. Binding of 1-3 for other biogenic amines, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters was negligible with the exception of moderate affinities for α1-adrenergic receptors (4-6-fold less potent than that for 5-HT1A receptor). Radioligands [11C]1-3 were efficiently prepared by 11C-O-methylation of the corresponding phenolic precursor in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields of 7-11% with > 99% chemical and radiochemical purities. Dynamic PET studies in rats demonstrated negligible brain uptake of [11C]1 and [11C]2. In contrast, significant brain uptake of [11C]3 was observed with an early peak SUV of 4-5. However, [11C]3 displayed significant off-target binding attributed to α1-adrenergic receptors based on regional distribution (thalamus>hippocampus) and blocking studies.


CONCLUSION
Despite efficient radiolabeling, results from PET imaging experiments limit the application of [11C]3 for in vivo quantification of 5-HT1A receptors. Nevertheless, derivatives of compound 3 may provide a scaffold for alternative PET radiotracers with improved selectivity for 5-HT 1A receptors or α1-adrenergic receptors.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",32430632,[11C]3,[11C]1-3,"α1-adrenergic receptors",NULL,NULL
31099,"The Acute and Early Effects of Whole-Brain Irradiation on Glial Activation, Brain Metabolism, and Behavior: a Positron Emission Tomography Study.","PURPOSE
Radiotherapy is a frequently applied treatment modality for brain tumors. Concomitant irradiation of normal brain tissue can induce various physiological responses. The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute and early-delayed effects of brain irradiation on glial activation and brain metabolism can be detected with positron emission tomography (PET) and whether these effects are correlated with behavioral changes.


PROCEDURES
Rats underwent 0-, 10-, or 25-Gy whole-brain irradiation. At 3 and 31 days post irradiation, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[11C]methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([11C]PK11195) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET scans were acquired to detect changes in glial activation (neuroinflammation) and glucose metabolism, respectively. The open-field test (OFT) was performed on days 6 and 27 to assess behavioral changes.


RESULTS
Twenty-five-gray-irradiated rats showed higher [11C]PK11195 uptake in most brain regions than controls on day 3 (striatum, hypothalamus, accumbens, septum p < 0.05), although some brain regions had lower uptake (cerebellum, parietal association/retrosplenial visual cortex, frontal association/motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, p < 0.05). On day 31, several brain regions in 25-Gy-irradiated rats still showed significantly higher [11C]PK11195 uptake than controls and 10-Gy-irradiated group (p < 0.05). Within-group analysis showed that [11C]PK11195 uptake in individual brain regions of 25-Gy treated rats remained stable or slightly increased between days 3 and 31. In contrast, a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in tracer uptake between days 3 and 31 was found in all brain areas of controls and 10-Gy-irradiated animals. Moreover, 10-Gy treatment led to a significantly higher [18F]FDG uptake on day 3 (p < 0.05). [18F]FDG uptake decreased between days 3 and 31 in all groups; no significant differences between groups were observed anymore on day 31, except for increased uptake in the hypothalamus in the 10-Gy group.

Evidence to date has failed to reveal unique female determinants of cardiovascular disease. However, a strong association was recently observed between increased metabolic activity in the amygdala, a neural centre involved in the processing of emotions, and impaired myocardial function in women, but not in men. Given the stronger immune responses in females, we sought to retrospectively investigate the interaction between inflammation, perceived stress, and myocardial injury.


METHODS
Overall, 294 patients (mean age 66.9 ± 10.0 years, 28.6% women) underwent both, 99mTc-tetrofosmin single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography for the assessment of cardiac function, bone marrow metabolism (surrogate marker of inflammation), and resting amygdalar activity.


RESULTS
A positive association was found between amygdalar metabolism and 18F-FDG bone marrow uptake in women (r = 0.238, p = 0.029), but not in men (r = 0.060, p = 0.385). Linear regression models selected both, abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and abnormal myocardial perfusion, as significant indicators of an increased amygdalar activity in women (B-coefficient LVEF, - 0.096; p = 0.021; abnormal myocardial perfusion, 3.227; p = 0.043), but not in men (bone marrow p = 0.076; abnormal myocardial perfusion p = 0.420). Accordingly, an interaction term consisting of sex and LVEF/abnormal myocardial perfusion was significant (p = 0.043 and p = 0.015, respectively).


CONCLUSIONS
Upregulated amygdalar metabolism is associated with an enhanced inflammatory state in female patients with impaired cardiac function. Given that enhanced activity of the limbic system is associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes, our study suggests that a focus on inflammatory markers and indicators of distress might help to tailor cardiovascular risk assessment and therapy towards the female cardiovascular phenotype.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31701187,18F-FDG,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)",NULL,NULL,NULL

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) uptake determined by PET and presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood independently predict outcomes.

The goal was to investigate whether 18F-FDG uptake measured by SUVmax/avg, but also measures of metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) (MTV × SUVavg), are associated with CTCs.


Methods
Prospectively, 7.5 mL blood was drawn from NSCLC patients at the time of staging 18F-FDG PET/CT and from healthy control subjects. CTCs were identified by immunofluorescent staining (CK8/18/19pos/EpCAMpos/CD45neg/DAPIpos nucleus). 18F-FDG PET/CTs were analyzed for SUVmax, SUVavg, MTV, and TLG.


Results
In 16 NSCLC patients with stage I-IIIA, MTV and TLG, in contrast to SUVmax and SUVavg, were positively associated with CTCs (linear regression analysis). No CTCs were detectable in 20 healthy control subjects.

After several iterations of protocol optimization (e.g., finding the optimal pH at which the isotopic exchange (IE) reaction produces high radiochemical yields (RCYs)), the SiFA technology achieved clinical applicability, as showcased by radiosynthesis of [18F]SiFAlin-TATE ([18F]SiTATE), the first SiFA peptide used in the clinical diagnosis of NETs. The TATE peptide binds to somatostatin receptors associated with NETs. Radiolabeled TATE derivatives are routinely applied in clinical oncological PET imaging. The (SiFA) 18F-labeling technology is based on the IE of a 19F atom for a radioactive 18F atom, a highly efficient labeling reaction under mild conditions. The 19F is part of a biomolecule bearing the SiFA building block, composed of a central silicon (Si) atom, a 19F atom connected to the Si atom, and two Si-bound tert-butyl groups. The IE proceeds through a penta-coordinate bipyramidal intermediate, followed by elimination of non-radioactive 19F, yielding the labeled compound in high RCYs at room temperature (22 °C).

Metabolic imaging using [18F]FDG is the current standard for clinical PET; however, some malignancies (e.g., indolent lymphomas) show low avidity for FDG.

We previously developed PET tracers based on the humanised anti-CD20 antibody obinutuzumab (GA101). Preclinical studies showed that the smallest bivalent fragment, the cys-diabody (GAcDb, 54.5 kDa) with a peak uptake at 1-2 h post-injection and a biological half-life of 2-5 h, is compatible with short-lived positron emitters such as fluorine-18 (18F, t1/2 110 min), enabling same-day imaging.

GAcDb was radiolabeled using amine-reactive N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]-fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB), or thiol-reactive N-[2-(4-[18F]-fluorobenzamido)ethyl]maleimide ([18F]FBEM) for site-specific conjugation to C-terminal cysteine residues. Both tracers were used for immunoPET imaging of the B cell compartment in human CD20 transgenic mice (hCD20TM). [18F]FB-GAcDb immunoPET was further evaluated in a disseminated lymphoma (A20-hCD20) syngeneic for hCD20TM and compared to [18F]FDG PET. Tracer uptake was confirmed by ex vivo biodistribution.


RESULTS
The GAcDb was successfully 18F-radiolabeled using two different conjugation methods resulting in similar specific activities and without impairing immunoreactivity. Both tracers ([18F]FB-GAcDb and [18F]FBEM-GAcDb) specifically target human CD20-expressing B cells in transgenic mice. Fast blood clearance results in high contrast PET images as early as 1 h post injection enabling same-day imaging. [18F]FB-GAcDb immunoPET detects disseminated lymphoma disease in the context of normal tissue expression of hCD20, with comparable sensitivity as [18F]FDG PET but with added specificity for the therapeutic target.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FB-GAcDb and [18F]FBEM-GAcDb could monitor normal B cells and B cell malignancies non-invasively and quantitatively in vivo. In contrast to [18F]FDG PET, immunoPET provides not only information about the extent of disease but also about presence and localisation of the therapeutic target.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",30456475,"[18F]FDG PET","[18F]FB-GAcDb immunoPET",hCD20,NULL,NULL
51016,"Imaging niacin trafficking with positron emission tomography reveals in vivo monocarboxylate transporter distribution.","INTRODUCTION
A sufficient dietary intake of the vitamin niacin is essential for normal cellular function. Niacin is transported into the cells by the monocarboxylate transporters: sodium-dependent monocarboxylate transporter (SMCT1 and SMCT2) and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1). Despite the importance of niacin in biological systems, surprisingly, its in vivo biodistribution and trafficking in living organisms has not been reported. The availability of niacin radiolabelled with the short-lived positron emitting radionuclide carbon-11 ([11C]niacin) would enable the quantitative in vivo study of this endogenous micronutrient trafficking using in vivo PET molecular imaging.


METHODS
[11C]Niacin was synthesised via a simple one-step, one-pot reaction in a fully automated system using cyclotron-produced carbon dioxide ([11C]CO2) and 3-pyridineboronic acid ester via a copper-mediated reaction. [11C]Niacin was administered intravenously in healthy anaesthetised mice placed in a high-resolution nanoScan PET/CT scanner. To further characterize in vivo [11C]niacin distribution in vivo, mice were challenged with either niacin or AZD3965, a potent and selective MCT1 inhibitor. To examine niacin gastrointestinal absorption and body distribution in vivo, no-carrier-added (NCA) and carrier-added (CA) [11C]niacin formulations were administered orally.


RESULTS
Total synthesis time including HPLC purification was 25 ± 1 min from end of [11C]CO2 delivery. [11C]Niacin was obtained with a decay corrected radiochemical yield of 17 ± 2%. We report a rapid radioactivity accumulation in the kidney, heart, eyes and liver of intravenously administered [11C]niacin which is consistent with the known in vivo SMCTs and MCT1 transporter tissue expression. Pre-administration of non-radioactive niacin decreased kidney-, heart-, ocular- and liver-uptake and increased urinary excretion of [11C]niacin. Pre-administration of AZD3965 selectively decreased [11C]niacin uptake in MCT1-expressing organs such as heart and retina. Following oral administration of NCA [11C]niacin, a high level of radioactivity accumulated in the intestines. CA abolished the intestinal accumulation of [11C]niacin resulting in a preferential distribution to all tissues expressing niacin transporters and the excretory organs.


CONCLUSIONS
Here, we describe the efficient preparation of [11C]niacin as PET imaging agent for probing the trafficking of nutrient demand in healthy rodents by intravenous and oral administration, providing a translatable technique to enable the future exploration of niacin trafficking in humans and to assess its application as a research tool for metabolic disorders (dyslipidaemia) and cancer.","Nuclear medicine and biology",32683248,[11C]niacin,"[11C]CO2 delivery",NULL,no-carrier-added,NULL
60426,"[Frequency of malignancy in thyroid incidentalomas detected by whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT].","BACKGROUND
Thyroid incidentalomas detected by 18F-Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT are defined as an incidental and unexpected thyroid focus present in a patient studied for a non-thyroid disease.


AIM
To assess the frequency of malignancy of nodular thyroid incidentalomas, and their association with 18F-FDG avidity (standard uptake value (SUV) max).


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Whole body PET/CT performed from December 2008 to December 2017 were reviewed selecting those that showed nodular thyroid foci. Glands with diffuse increased uptake were excluded. Thyroid ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) performed after PET/CT were reviewed. Bethesda score and SUVmax were correlated.


RESULTS
Of 5,100 whole body 18F-FDG PET/CT, 119 showed a thyroid nodular uptake (2.3%). Forty eight percent of these patients were studied with FNAC or surgery, 50% of which (29/58) were confirmed as malignant. Benign nodules showed significantly lower 18F-FDG uptake (n = 20, SUVmax: 3.5 ± 1.7) than Bethesda V-VI (n=24, SUVmax: 8.2 ± 5.2) and thyroid metastases (n=5, SUVmax: 6.3 ± 2.1). The best cut-off value to distinguish between benign and malignant nodules was a SUVmax of 5.0, with a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence intervals (CI) 56-90%), a specificity of 85% (95% CI 62 - 97%), and positive likelihood ratio of 5 (95% CI 1.8 - 14.6). The size of the thyroid nodule was not predictive of malignancy.


CONCLUSIONS
Half of nodular thyroid incidentalomas detected by 18F-FDG PETC/CT are malignant. A nodule with a SUVmax ≥ 5,0 is highly suggestive of malignancy, regardless of its size.","Revista medica de Chile",32730431,18F-Fludeoxyglucose,"18F-FDG PETC/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL

Posttranslational modifications of tau, a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, by O-GlcNAc through the enzyme pair OGA and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) are inversely related to the amounts of its insoluble hyperphosphorylated form. Increase in tau O-GlcNAcylation by OGA inhibition is believed to reduce tau aggregation. LSN3316612, a highly selective and potent OGA ligand [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.9 nM], emerged as a lead ligand after in silico analysis and in vitro evaluations. [3H]LSN3316612 imaged and quantified OGA in postmortem brains of rat, monkey, and human. The presence of fluorine and carbonyl functionality in LSN3316612 enabled labeling with positron-emitting fluorine-18 or carbon-11. Both [18F]LSN3316612 and [11C]LSN3316612 bound reversibly to OGA in vivo, and such binding was blocked by pharmacological doses of thiamet G, an OGA inhibitor of different chemotype, in monkeys. [18F]LSN3316612 entered healthy human brain avidly (~4 SUV) without radiodefluorination or adverse effect from other radiometabolites, as evidenced by stable brain total volume of distribution (VT) values by 110 min of scanning.

3750,"Positron Emission Tomography in Merkel Cell Carcinoma.","Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine skin malignancy usually arising as a nonspecific nodule on sun-exposed areas of the head and neck. Given the poor prognosis of this aggressive tumor, assessment of disease burden in pre- and post-treatment care may ensure an optimal management with significant implications for patient surveillance and prognosis. Although imaging has established its role in locally advanced or distant metastatic MCC, a standard imaging algorithm is yet to be determined and respective recommendations are mainly based on melanoma. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is increasingly evolving as a valuable imaging tool in metastatic or unresectable MCC, mostly utilizing the glucose analogue 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) as a radiotracer. Despite being inferior in detecting the disease in its early stages compared to the "gold standard" of sentinel lymph node biopsy, recent evidence suggests an important role for 18F-FDG PET/CT in the routine workup of localized MCC. Moreover, 68Ga-labeled somatostatin analogues have been employed as PET tracers in the field of MCC with promising, yet comparable to 18F-FDG, results.

In this study, the feasibility of the quantification of prostate cancer aggressiveness using parametric methods assessing [11C]-acetate kinetics was investigated in prostate cancer subjects. The underlying uptake mechanism correlated with [11C]-acetate influx and efflux measured in real-time in vitro in cell culture. Methods: Twenty-one patients with newly diagnosed low-to-moderate risk prostate cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic [11C]-acetate PET/CT examinations of the pelvis. Parametric images of K1 (extraction × perfusion), k2 (oxidative metabolism) and VT (=K1/k2, anabolic metabolism defined as carbon retention) were constructed using a one-tissue compartment model with an arterial input function derived from pelvic arteries. Regions of interest (ROIs) of the largest cancer lesion in each patient and normal prostate tissue were drawn using information from MRI (T2 and DWI images), biopsy results, and post-surgical histopathology of whole prostate sections (n=7). In vitro kinetics of [11C]-acetate were studied on DU145 and PC3 cell lines using LigandTracer® White equipment for the measurement of the radioactivity uptake in real-time at 37°C. Results: Mean prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 8.33±3.92 ng/mL and median Gleason Sum 6 (range 5-7). K1, VT and standardized uptake values (SUVs) were significantly higher in cancerous prostate tissues compared to normal ones for all patients (p<0.001), while k2 was not (p=0.26). PSA values correlated to early SUVs (r=0.50, p=0.02) and K1 (r=0.48, p=0.03). Early and late SUVs correlated to VT (r>0.76, p<0.001) and K1 (r>0.64, p<0.005). In vitro studies demonstrated higher extraction and retention (p<0.01) of [11C]-acetate in the more aggressive PC3 cells. Conclusion: Parametric images could be used to visualize the [11C]-acetate kinetics of the prostate cancer exhibiting elevated extraction associated with the cancer aggressiveness.

31094,"Novel multifunctional 18F-labelled PET tracer with prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeting and hypoxia-sensitive moieties.","Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently found cancers in men worldwide. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is typically highly expressed in prostate cancer, and the Glu-Urea-Lys (GUL) structure has recently received considerable attention as a key unit of PSMA-targeting agents. Additionally, one of the common characteristics of many solid tumors, such as prostate cancer, is hypoxia. In this study, novel multifunctional PSMA inhibitors containing a PSMA-targeting moiety either with or without a hypoxia-sensitive moiety (18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-2NI-GUL and 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-GUL, respectively; ADIBOT: azadibenzocyclooctatriazole, 2NI: 2-nitroimidazole) were designed and synthesized, and their feasibility as PET tracers for prostate cancer imaging studies was examined. The compounds labelled with 18F via the copper-free click reaction were stable in human serum and showed nanomolar binding affinities in in vitro PSMA binding assays. Micro-PET and biodistribution studies indicate that both 18F-labelled inhibitors successfully accumulated in prostate cancer regions, and 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-2NI-GUL showed a 2-fold higher tumor-to-total non-target organ ratio than that of 18F-PEG3-ADIBOT-GUL, suggesting that the synergistic effects of the PSMA-targeting GUL moiety and the hypoxia-sensitive 2-nitroimidazole moiety can increase tumor uptake of the novel PET tracers in prostate cancer.

9173,"Biodistribution and first clinical results of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE PET: a novel 18F-labeled somatostatin analog for imaging of neuroendocrine tumors.","INTRODUCTION
PET/CT using 68Ga-labeled somatostatin analogs (SSA) targeting somatostatin receptors (SSR) on the cell surface of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) represents the clinical reference standard for imaging. However, economic and logistic challenges of the 68Ge/68Ga generator-based approach have disadvantages over 18F-labeled compounds. Here, we present the first in-human data of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE, a novel 18F-labeled, SSR-targeting peptide. The aim was to compare the intra-individual biodistribution, tumor uptake, and image quality of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE to the clinical reference standard 68Ga-DOTA-TOC.


METHODS
Thirteen patients with NET staged with both 68Ga-DOTA-TOC and 18F-SiFAlin-TATE PET/CT have been included in this retrospective analysis. We compared the biodistribution in normal organs and tumor uptake of NET lesions by SUVmean and SUVmax measurement for tracers. Additionally mean and max tumor-to-liver (TLR) and tumor-to-spleen ratios (TSR) have been calculated by division of SUVmean and SUVmax of tumor lesions by the SUVmean of the liver and spleen, respectively. Additionally, image quality was visually rated by 5 blinded readers and an intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis on inter-observer agreement has been performed.


RESULTS
Compared with 68Ga-DOTA-TOC, the biodistribution of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE showed somewhat higher, however, statistically not significant higher uptake in the liver, spleen, and adrenal glands. Significantly higher uptake was observed in the kidneys. Tumor uptake was higher in most tumor lesions with significantly higher uptake in common metastatic sites of NET including the liver (SUVmax 18.8 ± 8.4 vs. 12.8 ± 5.6; p < 0.001), lymph nodes (SUVmax 23.8 ± 20.7 vs. 17.4 ± 16.1; p < 0.001) and bone (SUVmax 16.0 ± 10.1 vs. 10.3 ± 5.7; p < 0.01) for 18F-SiFAlin-TATE. The high tumor uptake resulted in favorable TLR and TSR, comparable with that of 68Ga-DOTA-TOC. The ICC analysis on the inter-observer agreement on image quality was substantial and almost perfect. Image quality was rated as excellent in most cases in both 68Ga-DOTA-TOC and 18F-SiFAlin-TATE PET.


CONCLUSION
The favorable characteristics of 18F-SiFAlin-TATE with a high image quality, the kit-like labeling procedure, and the promising clinical performance enable improved logistics and diagnostic possibilities for PET imaging of NET.

The U87MG cell binding of [64Cu]2 showed a time-dependent increase over 24 h and it was inhibited by 38% at 4 h in the presence of tetrac, indicating specificity of [64Cu]2 to the thyroid hormone receptor site on integrin αVβ3. Positron emission tomography (PET) images of U87MG tumor-bearing mice injected with [64Cu]1 and [64Cu]2 revealed that high radioactivity accumulated in the tumors, and that the tumor uptake and tumor-to-nontarget uptake ratio were higher in small tumors than in large tumors.

In this study, we characterized the relationships among tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) retention, tumor metabolic and immune phenotypes, and survival in patients with resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively analyzed tumor preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) 18F-FDG uptake in 59 resected NSCLCs and investigated correlations between PET parameters (SUVMax, SUVTotal, SUVMean, TLG), tumor expression of glycolysis- and immune-related genes, and tumor-associated immune cell densities that were quantified by immunohistochemistry. Tumor glycolysis-associated immune gene signatures were analyzed for associations with survival outcomes. We found that each 18F-FDG PET parameter was positively correlated with tumor expression of glycolysis-related genes. Elevated 18F-FDG SUVMax was more discriminatory of glycolysis-associated changes in tumor immune phenotypes than other 18F-FDG PET parameters. Increased SUVMax was associated with multiple immune factors characteristic of an immunosuppressive and poorly immune infiltrated tumor microenvironment, including elevated PD-L1 expression, reduced CD57+ cell density, and increased T cell exhaustion gene signature. Elevated SUVMax identified immune-related transcriptomic signatures that were associated with enhanced tumor glycolytic gene expression and poor clinical outcomes.

Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) with 68Ga-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen ligand (68Ga-PSMA) may represent the most promising alternative to multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis.


OBJECTIVE
To test the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in this clinical context.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
From January 2017 to December 2018 we prospectively enrolled 97 patients with persistently elevated prostate-specific antigen and/or Prostate Health Index score, negative digital rectal examination, and previous negative biopsy. We also included patients with either negative mpMRI or contraindications to or positive mpMRI but previous negative biopsy.


INTERVENTION
Patients underwent 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT with additional pelvic reconstruction.


OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The primary endpoint of the study was the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT in detecting malignant lesions and clinically significant PCa (Gleason score [GS] ≥7).


RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS
68Ga-PSMA PET/transrectal ultrasound fusion biopsy was performed in 64 of 97 patients (66%) for 114 regions of interest (ROIs). Forty patients (41%) had already undergone mpMRI with either a negative result for PCa (n = 15; 22 ROIs) or a positive mpMRI result but a previous negative biopsy. According to pathology, 23 patients (36%) had evidence of PCa: eight (16 ROIs) with GS 6, 13 (21 ROIs) with GS 7 (3 + 4 or 4 + 3), one (2 ROIs) with GS 8, and one (2 ROIs) with GS 10. Clinically significant PCa was identified in four patients with previous negative mpMRI (25%). PET/CT demonstrated PCa in seven patients (14 ROIs) with previous positive mpMRI and negative biopsy. The median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and median SUV ratio were significantly higher for PCa lesions than for benign lesions (p <  0.001). Optimal cutoff points obtained for SUVmax (>5.4) and SUV ratio (>2.2) could identify clinically significant PCa with accuracy of 81% and 90%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
In our cohort of patients with high suspicion of cancer,68Ga-PSMA PET/CT was capable of detecting malignancy and accurately identifying clinically relevant PCa.

Accumulating evidence indicates that it plays a crucial role in psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with a TRPC5 specific radioligand may provide a unique tool to investigate the functions of TRPC5 in animal disease models to guide drug development targeting TRPC5.

Moreover, initial in vivo evaluation of [11C]HC608 performed in rodents and the microPET study in the brain of non-human primates further demonstrated that [11C]HC608 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and sufficiently accumulate in the brain. These results suggest that [11C]HC608 has the potential to be a PET tracer for imaging TRPC5 in vivo.","Organic & biomolecular chemistry",31115430,[11C]HC608,"[11C]methyl iodide",TRPC5,NULL,NULL
64699,"Clinical impact of digital and conventional PET control databases for semi-quantitative analysis of brain 18F-FDG digital PET scans.","PURPOSE
Digital PET cameras markedly improve sensitivity and spatial resolution of brain 18F-FDG PET images compared to conventional cameras. Our study aimed to assess whether specific control databases are required to improve the diagnostic performance of these recent advances.


METHODS
We retrospectively selected two groups of subjects, twenty-seven Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients and twenty-two healthy control (HC) subjects. All subjects underwent a brain 18F-FDG PET on a digital camera (Vereos, Philips®). These two group (AD and HC) are compared, using a Semi-Quantitative Analysis (SQA), to two age and sex matched controls acquired with a digital PET/CT (Vereos, Philips®) or a conventional PET/CT (Biograph 6, Siemens®) camera, at group and individual levels. Moreover, individual visual interpretation of SPM T-maps was provided for the positive diagnosis of AD by 3 experienced raters.


RESULTS
At group level, SQA using digital controls detected more marked hypometabolic areas in AD (+ 116 cm3 at p < 0.001 uncorrected for the voxel, corrected for the cluster) than SQA using conventional controls. At the individual level, the accuracy of SQA for discriminating AD using digital controls was higher than SQA using conventional controls (86% vs. 80%, p < 0.01, at p < 0.005 uncorrected for the voxel, corrected for the cluster), with higher sensitivity (89% vs. 78%) and similar specificity (82% vs. 82%). These results were confirmed by visual analysis (accuracies of 84% and 82% for digital and conventional controls respectively, p = 0.01).


CONCLUSION
There is an urgent need to establish specific digital PET control databases for SQA of brain 18F-FDG PET images as such databases improve the accuracy of AD diagnosis.","EJNMMI research",33258085,18F-FDG,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Selective MAO-B inhibitors have been labeled with carbon-11 or fluorine-18 to visualize the localization of MAO-B in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) and thereby have been useful for studying neurodegenerative diseases. The aim of this study was to develop promising fluorine-18 labeled reversible MAO-B PET radioligands and their biological evaluation in vitro by autoradiography. Radiolabeling was achieved by classical one-step fluorine-18 nucleophilic substitution reaction. The stability and radiochemical yield was analyzed with HPLC. All five fluorine-18 labeled compounds were tested in human whole hemisphere autoradiography experiments. Five compounds (GEH200439, GEH200448, GEH200449, GEH200431A, and GEH200431B) were successfully radiolabeled with fluorine-18, and the incorporation yield of the fluorination reactions varied from 10 to 45% depending on the compound. The radiochemical purity was higher than 99% for all at the end of synthesis. Radioligands were found to be stable, with a radiochemical purity of >99% in a sterile phosphate buffered saline (pH = 7.4) over the duration of the study. The ARG binding density of only 18F-GEH200449 was consistent with known MAO-B expression in the human brain.

23950,"Spinal cord hypermetabolism extends to skeletal muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: a computational approach to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT images.","PURPOSE
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease leading to neuromuscular palsy and death. We propose a computational approach to [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT images to analyze the structure and metabolic pattern of skeletal muscle in ALS and its relationship with disease aggressiveness.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A computational 3D method was used to extract whole psoas muscle's volumes and average attenuation coefficient (AAC) from CT images obtained by FDG PET/CT performed in 62 ALS patients and healthy controls. Psoas average standardized uptake value (normalized on the liver, N-SUV) and its distribution heterogeneity (defined as N-SUV variation coefficient, VC-SUV) were also extracted. Spinal cord and brain motor cortex FDG uptake were also estimated.


RESULTS
As previously described, FDG uptake was significantly higher in the spinal cord and lower in the brain motor cortex, in ALS compared to controls. While psoas AAC was similar in patients and controls, in ALS a significant reduction in psoas volume (3.6 ± 1.02 vs 4.12 ± 1.33 mL/kg; p < 0.01) and increase in psoas N-SUV (0.45 ± 0.19 vs 0.29 ± 0.09; p < 0.001) were observed. Higher heterogeneity of psoas FDG uptake was also documented in ALS (VC-SUV 8 ± 4%, vs 5 ± 2%, respectively, p < 0.001) and significantly predicted overall survival at Kaplan-Meier analysis. VC-SUV prognostic power was confirmed by univariate analysis, while the multivariate Cox regression model identified the spinal cord metabolic activation as the only independent prognostic biomarker.


CONCLUSION
The present data suggest the existence of a common mechanism contributing to disease progression through the metabolic impairment of both second motor neuron and its effector.","EJNMMI research",32201914,[18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose,"N-SUV variation coefficient",VC-SUV,"FDG PET/CT",NULL
40818,"[18F]Atorvastatin: synthesis of a potential molecular imaging tool for the assessment of statin-related mechanisms of action.","BACKGROUND
Statins are lipid-lowering agents that inhibit cholesterol synthesis and are clinically used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, a considerable group of patients does not respond to statin treatment, and the reason for this is still not completely understood. [18F]Atorvastatin, the 18F-labeled version of one of the most widely prescribed statins, may be a useful tool for statin-related research.


RESULTS
[18F]Atorvastatin was synthesized via an optimized ruthenium-mediated late-stage 18F-deoxyfluorination. The defluoro-hydroxy precursor was produced via Paal-Knorr pyrrole synthesis and was followed by coordination of the phenol to a ruthenium complex, affording the labeling precursor in approximately 10% overall yield. Optimization and automation of the labeling procedure reliably yielded an injectable solution of [18F]atorvastatin in 19% ± 6% (d.c.) with a molar activity of 65 ± 32 GBq·μmol-1. Incubation of [18F]atorvastatin in human serum did not lead to decomposition. Furthermore, we have shown the ability of [18F]atorvastatin to cross the hepatic cell membrane to the cytosolic and microsomal fractions where HMG-CoA reductase is known to be highly expressed. Blocking assays using rat liver sections confirmed the specific binding to HMG-CoA reductase. Autoradiography on rat aorta stimulated to develop atherosclerotic plaques revealed that [18F]atorvastatin significantly accumulates in this tissue when compared to the healthy model.


CONCLUSIONS
The improved ruthenium-mediated 18F-deoxyfluorination procedure overcomes previous hurdles such as the addition of salt additives, the drying steps, or the use of different solvent mixtures at different phases of the process, which increases its practical use, and may allow faster translation to clinical settings. Based on tissue uptake evaluations, [18F]atorvastatin showed the potential to be used as a tool for the understanding of the mechanism of action of statins. Further knowledge of the in vivo biodistribution of [18F]atorvastatin may help to better understand the origin of off-target effects and potentially allow to distinguish between statin-resistant and non-resistant patients.","EJNMMI research",32296962,[18F]atorvastatin,"18F-labeled version",NULL,NULL,NULL
11108,"[18F]CB251 PET/MR imaging probe targeting translocator protein (TSPO) independent of its Polymorphism in a Neuroinflammation Model.","The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has been proposed as a biomarker for the detection of neuroinflammation. Although various PET probes targeting TSPO have been developed, a highly selective probe for detecting TSPO is still needed because single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human TSPO gene greatly affect the binding affinity of TSPO ligands. Here, we describe the visualization of neuroinflammation with a multimodality imaging system using our recently developed TSPO-targeting radionuclide PET probe [18F]CB251, which is less affected by TSPO polymorphisms. Methods: To test the selectivity of [18F]CB251 for TSPO polymorphisms, 293FT cells expressing polymorphic TSPO were generated by introducing the coding sequences of wild-type (WT) and mutant (Alanine → Threonine at 147th Amino Acid; A147T) forms. Competitive inhibition assay was conducted with [3H]PK11195 and various TSPO ligands using membrane proteins isolated from 293FT cells expressing TSPO WT or mutant-A147T, representing high-affinity binder (HAB) or low-affinity binder (LAB), respectively. IC50 values of each ligand to [3H]PK11195 in HAB or LAB were measured and the ratio of IC50 values of each ligand to [3H]PK11195 in HAB to LAB was calculated, indicating the sensitivity of TSPO polymorphism. Cellular uptake of [18F]CB251 was measured with different TSPO polymorphisms, and phantom studies of [18F]CB251-PET using 293FT cells were performed. To test TSPO-specific cellular uptake of [18F]CB251, TSPO expression was regulated with pCMV-TSPO (or shTSPO)/eGFP vector. Intracranial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment was used to induce regional inflammation in the mouse brain. Gadolinium (Gd)-DOTA MRI was used to monitor the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and infiltration by immune cells. Infiltration of peripheral immune cells across the BBB, which exacerbates neuroinflammation to produce higher levels of neurotoxicity, was also monitored with bioluminescence imaging (BLI). Peripheral immune cells isolated from luciferase-expressing transgenic mice were transferred to syngeneic inflamed mice. Neuroinflammation was monitored with [18F]CB251-PET/MR and BLI. To evaluate the effects of anti-inflammatory agents on intracranial inflammation, an inflammatory cytokine inhibitor, 2-cyano-3, 12-dioxooleana-1, 9-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester (CDDO-Me) was administered in intracranial LPS challenged mice. Results: The ratio of IC50 values of [18F]CB251 in HAB to LAB indicated similar binding affinity to WT and mutant TSPO and was less affected by TSPO polymorphisms. [18F]CB251 was specific for TSPO, and its cellular uptake reflected the amount of TSPO. Higher [18F]CB251 uptake was also observed in activated immune cells. Simultaneous [18F]CB251-PET/MRI showed that [18F]CB251 radioactivity was co-registered with the MR signals in the same region of the brain of LPS-injected mice. Luciferase-expressing peripheral immune cells were located at the site of LPS-injected right striatum. Quantitative evaluation of the anti-inflammatory effect of CDDO-Me on neuroinflammation was successfully monitored with TSPO-targeting [18F]CB251-PET/MR and BLI. Conclusion: Our results indicate that [18F]CB251-PET has great potential for detecting neuroinflammation with higher TSPO selectivity regardless of polymorphisms. Our multimodal imaging system, [18F]CB251-PET/MRI, tested for evaluating the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents in preclinical studies, might be an effective method to assess the severity and therapeutic response of neuroinflammation.",Theranostics,32802194,[18F]CB251-PET/MRI,"9-dien-28-oic acid methyl ester",MR,"LPS-injected right striatum","293FT cells"
14013,"PET imaging of beta-secretase 1 in the human brain: radiation dosimetry, quantification, and test-retest examination of [18F]PF-06684511.","PURPOSE
Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) enzyme is implicated in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. [18F]PF-06684511 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging BACE1. Despite favorable brain kinetic properties, the effective dose (ED) of [18F]PF-06684511 estimated in non-human primates was relatively high. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the whole-body distribution, dosimetry, quantification, and test-retest reliability of imaging brain BACE1 with [18F]PF-06684511 in healthy volunteers.


METHODS
Five subjects were studied for the dosimetry study. Whole-body PET was performed for 366 min with 4 PET-CT sessions. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose were calculated using the male adult model. Eight subjects participated in the test-retest study. Brain PET measurements were conducted for 123 min with an interval of 5 to 19 days between test and retest conditions. The total distribution volume (VT) was estimated with one-tissue (1T), two-tissue (2T), compartment model (CM), and graphical analysis. Test-retest variability (TRV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of VT were calculated as reliability measures.


RESULTS
In the dosimetry study, the highest uptake was found in the liver (25.2 ± 2.3 %ID at 0.5 h) and the largest dose was observed in the pancreas (92.9 ± 52.2 μSv/MBq). The calculated ED was 24.7 ± 0.8 μSv/MBq. In the test-retest study, 2TCM described the time-activity curves well. VT (2TCM) was the highest in the anterior cingulate cortex (6.28 ± 1.09 and 6.85 ± 0.81) and the lowest in the cerebellum (4.23 ± 0.88 and 4.20 ± 0.75). Mean TRV and ICC of VT (2TCM) were 16.5% (12.4-20.5%) and 0.496 (0.291-0.644).


CONCLUSION
The ED of [18F]PF-06684511 was similar to other 18F radioligands, allowing repeated PET measurements. 2TCM was the most appropriate quantification method. TRV of VT was similar to other radioligands without a reference region, albeit with lower ICC. These data indicated that [18F]PF-06684511 is a suitable radioligand to measure BACE1 level in the human brain.

14937,"Synthesis and Evaluation of 18F-INER-1577-3 as a Central Nervous System (CNS) Histone Deacetylase Imaging Agent.","BACKGROUND
Epigenetic dysfunction is implicated in many neurologic, psychiatric and oncologic diseases. Consequently, histone deacetylases (HDACs) inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic and imaging agents for these diseases. However, only a few radiotracers have been developed as HDACs imaging agents for the central nervous system (CNS). We report herein the synthesis and evaluation of [18F]INER-1577-3 ([18F]5) as an HDACs imaging agent for CNS.


METHODS
[18F]INER-1577-3 ([18F]5) was synthesized by two methods: one-step (A) and two-step (B) methods. Briefly, radiofluorination of the corresponding precursors (11, 12) with K[18F]/K2.2.2 followed by purifications with HPLC gave ([18F]5). The quality of [18F]INER- 1577-3 synthesized by these methods was verified by HPLC and TLC as compared to an authentic sample. The inhibitions of [18F]INER-1577-3 and related HDACs inhibitors on tumor cells growth were carried out with breast cancer cell line 4T1 and MCF-7. The whole-body and brain uptake of [18F]INER-1577-3 in rats and AD mice were determined using a micro-PET scanner and the data was analyzed using PMOD.


RESULTS
The radiochemical yield of [18F]INER-1577-3 synthesized by these two methods was 1.4 % (Method A) and 8.8% (Method B) (EOB), respectively. The synthesis time was 115 min and 100 min, respectively, from EOB. The inhibition studies showed that INER-1577-3 has a significant inhibitory effect in HDAC6 and HDAC8 but not HDAC2. PET studies in rats and AD mice showed a maximum at about 15 min postinjection for the whole brain of a rat (0.47 ± 0.03 %ID/g), SAMP8 mice (5.63 ± 1.09 %ID/g) and SAMR1 mice (7.23 ± 1.21 %ID/g).


CONCLUSION
This study showed that INER-1577-3 can inhibit tumor cell growth and is one of a few HDACs inhibitors that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and monitor HDAC activities in AD mice. Thus, [18F]INER-1577-3 may be a potent HDACs imaging agent, especially for CNS.","Current medical imaging",33081659,[18F]5,[18F]INER-1577-3,HDAC,NULL,MCF-7
28213,"Advances in Immuno-PET in the Detection of Cancer and Assessment of Response to Therapy.","BACKGROUND
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against tumor-associated antigens have been shown to target tumors with specificity and selectivity; therefore, it was hypothesized that cancer could be treated with mAbs without side effects. In the early 1980s, clinical studies demonstrated that tumors could be visualized using radiolabeled mAbs. However, with the introduction of positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), antibody-based imaging became less important because of its limited diagnostic accuracy. During the last two decades, a revival of imaging with radiolabeled mAbs has taken place, specifically PET with longer half-life isotopes. Development of immune checkpoints as targets for immunotherapy has opened opportunities for development of a wide variety of antibodies, such as anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-L1, and anti-PD1. Thus, imaging with these antibodies radiolabeled with 89Zr or another long-half-life PET isotope, known as immuno-PET, has become mainstream.


OBJECTIVE
To review the rapid development of immuno-PET for the detection of cancer and assessment of therapeutic response combining surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy. This review includes reports on the radiolabeling, imaging and clinical utility of 89Zr-, 64Cu-, and 124I-labeled mAbs.


RESULTS
More than 120 research and review articles on immuno-PET were reviewed.


CONCLUSION
Many mAbs have been developed and used for treatment of cancer; however, a limited number of antibodies have been radiolabeled for immuno-PET. While much progress has been made with the therapeutic applications of mAbs, immuno-PET for diagnosis and treatment assessment needs more work. Improved chelating agents and extensive imaging studies are needed to refine immuno-PET for the diagnosis of cancers and assessment of response to therapy.","Current medicinal chemistry",32003655,64Cu-,"124I-labeled mAbs",mAbs,NULL,NULL

We aimed to characterize the cerebral binding of [18F]-APN-1607 in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients compared to normal control (NC) subjects. Therefore, we obtained static late frame PET recordings with [18F]-APN-1607 and [18F]-FDG in patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD group, along with an age-matched NC group ([18F]-APN-1607 only). Using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) and volume of interest (VOI) analyses of the reference region normalized standardized uptake value ratio maps, we then tested for group differences and relationships between both PET biomarkers, as well as their associations with clinical general cognition. In the AD group, [18F]-APN-1607 binding was elevated in widespread cortical regions (P < 0.001 for VOI analysis, familywise error-corrected P < 0.01 for SPM analysis). The regional uptake in AD patients correlated negatively with Mini-Mental State Examination score (frontal lobe: R = -0.632, P = 0.004; temporal lobe: R = -0.593, P = 0.008; parietal lobe: R = -0.552, P = 0.014; insula: R = -0.650, P = 0.003; cingulum: R = -0.665, P = 0.002) except occipital lobe (R = -0.417, P = 0.076).

This first-in-human study investigated the safety, tolerability, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of this radiopharmaceutical. Methods: Six healthy males underwent dynamic whole-body PET/CT. Serial venous blood samples were drawn from 1-240 min after intravenous injection of 162 ± 4 MBq of 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9. In addition to gamma counting, the plasma samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to detect intact tracer and radioactive metabolites. Radiation doses were calculated using the OLINDA/EXM 2.2 software. In addition, a patient with early rheumatoid arthritis was studied with both 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 and 18F-FDG PET/CT to determine the ability of the new tracer to detect arthritis. Results: 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 was well tolerated by all subjects. 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 was rapidly cleared from blood circulation and several radioactive metabolites were detected. The organs with the highest absorbed doses were the urinary bladder wall (0.38 mSv/MBq) and kidneys (0.054 mSv/MBq). The mean effective dose was 0.022 mSv/MBq (range 0.020-0.024 mSv/MBq). Most importantly, however, 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 was able to detect arthritis comparable to 18F-FDG.

The effective radiation dose of 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 was within the same range as those of other 68Ga-labeled tracers. Injection of 150 MBq of 68Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 would expose a subject to 3.3 mSv.

Nineteen clinically probable DLB and 20 similarly aged controls underwent 3T structural MRI (T1-weighted) and diffusion-weighted imaging. Eighteen DLB subjects also underwent [11C]-PK11195 PET imaging and 15 had [11C]-Pittsburgh compound B amyloid PET, resulting in 9/15 being amyloid-positive.

38654,"Application of PET Tracers in Molecular Imaging for Breast Cancer.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW
Molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool to visualize breast cancer characteristics. Nonetheless, implementation of PET imaging into cancer care is challenging, and essential steps have been outlined in the international "imaging biomarker roadmap." In this review, we identify hurdles and provide recommendations for implementation of PET biomarkers in breast cancer care, focusing on the PET tracers 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]-FDG), sodium [18F]-fluoride ([18F]-NaF), 16α-[18F]-fluoroestradiol ([18F]-FES), and [89Zr]-trastuzumab.


RECENT FINDINGS
Technical validity of [18F]-FDG, [18F]-NaF, and [18F]-FES is established and supported by international guidelines. However, support for clinical validity and utility is still pending for these PET tracers in breast cancer, due to variable endpoints and procedures in clinical studies. Assessment of clinical validity and utility is essential towards implementation; however, these steps are still lacking for PET biomarkers in breast cancer. This could be solved by adding PET biomarkers to randomized trials, development of imaging data warehouses, and harmonization of endpoints and procedures.","Current oncology reports",32627087,[18F]-FES,"sodium [18F]-fluoride",NULL,NULL,NULL
69670,"Matched-pair comparison of 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7 PET/CT in patients with primary and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer: frequency of non-tumor related uptake and tumor positivity.","Purpose: Radiohybrid prostate-specific membrane antigen (rhPSMA) ligands are a new class of prostate cancer theranostic agents. 18F-rhPSMA-7, offers the advantages of 18F-labelling and low urinary excretion compared with 68Ga-PSMA-11. Here, we compare frequency of non-tumor related uptake and tumor positivity with 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7 in patients with primary or recurrent prostate cancer. Methods: This retrospective matched-pair comparison matched 160 18F-rhPSMA-7 with 160 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT studies for primary staging (n = 33) and biochemical recurrence (n = 127) according to clinical characteristics. Two nuclear medicine physicians reviewed all scans, first, identifying all PET-positive lesions, then differentiating lesions suspicious for prostate cancer from those that were benign, based on known pitfalls and ancillary information from CT. For each region, SUVmax of the lesion with the highest PSMA-ligand uptake was noted. Tumor positivity rates were determined and SUVmax were compared separately for each tracer. Results: 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed 566 and 289 PSMA-ligand positive lesions, respectively. Of these, 379 and 100 lesions, equaling 67.0 % and 34.6 % of all PSMA-positive lesions were considered benign, respectively. The distribution of their etiology was similar (42%, 24%, 25% in 18F-rhPSMA-7 vs. 32%, 24%, 38% in 68Ga-PSMA-11 for ganglia, bone and unspecific lymph nodes, respectively). All primary tumors were positive with both agents (n = 33 each) while slightly more metastatic lesions were observed with 68Ga-PSMA-11 in both disease stages (113 for 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 124 for 68Ga-PSMA-11). SUVmax of 18F-rhPSMA-7 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 did not differ (P > 0.05) in local recurrence or primary prostate cancer, however, the tumor-to-bladder ratio was significantly higher with 18F-rhPSMA-7 (4.9±5.3 vs 2.2±3.7, P = 0.02 for local recurrence and 9.8±9.7 vs 2.3±2.6, P < 0.001 for primary prostate cancer). Conclusion: The tumor positivity rate was consistently high for 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-rhPSMA-7. Both tracers revealed a considerable number of areas of uptake that were reliably identified as benign by trained physicians making use of corresponding morphological imaging and known PSMA pitfalls. These were more frequent with 18F-rhPSMA-7. However, the matched-pair comparison could have introduced a source of bias. Adequate reader training can allow physicians to differentiate benign uptake from disease and be able to benefit from the logistical and clinical advantages of 18F-rhPSMA-7.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",33277394,68Ga-PSMA-11,"9.8±9.7 vs 2.3±2.6",PSMA,NULL,NULL
72464,"Practical Synthesis of [18F]Pitavastatin and Evaluation of Hepatobiliary Transport Activity in Rats by Positron Emission Tomography.","We developed a practical synthetic method for fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled pitavastatin ([18F]PTV) as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer to assess hepatobiliary transporter activity and conducted a PET scan as a preclinical study for proof-of-concept in rats. This method is a one-pot synthesis involving aromatic 18F-fluorination of an arylboronic acid ester followed by deprotection under acidic conditions, which can be reproduced in general clinical sites equipped with a standard radiolabeling system due to the simplified procedure. PET imaging confirmed that intravenously administered [18F]PTV was rapidly accumulated in the liver and gradually transferred into the intestinal lumen through the bile duct. Radiometabolite analysis showed that [18F]PTV was metabolically stable, and 80% of the injected dose was detected as the unchanged form in both blood and bile. We applied integration plot analysis to assess tissue uptake clearance (CLuptake, liver and CLuptake, kidney) and canalicular efflux clearance (CLint, bile), and examined the effects of inhibitors on membrane transport. Treatment with rifampicin, an organic anion transporting polypeptide inhibitor, significantly reduced CLuptake, liver and CLuptake, kidney to 44% and 64% of control, respectively. In contrast, Ko143, a breast cancer resistance protein inhibitor, did not affect CLuptake, liver but significantly reduced CLint, bile to 39% of control without change in [18F]PTV blood concentration. In addition, we found decreased CLuptake, liver and increased CLint, bile in Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats in response to altered expression levels of transporters. We expect that [18F]PTV can be translated into clinical application, as our synthetic method does not need special apparatus in the radiolabeling system and PET scan with [18F]PTV can quantitatively evaluate transporter activity in vivo.","Molecular pharmaceutics",32271581,[18F]PTV,"fluorine-18 (18F)-labeled pitavastatin",CLuptake,NULL,NULL

In this study, we evaluated if the Met-Val-Lys (MVK) linker could be used to lower kidney uptake of 68Ga-labeled DOTA-conjugated peptides and peptidomimetics. A model compound, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(Ac)-OH (AmBz: aminomethylbenzoyl), and its derivative, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(HTK01166)-OH, coupled with the PSMA (prostate-specific membrane antigen)-targeting motif of the previously reported HTK01166 were synthesized and evaluated to determine if they could be recognized and cleaved by the renal brush border enzymes. Additionally, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo stability studies were conducted in mice to evaluate their pharmacokinetics. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(Ac)-OH was effectively cleaved specifically by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) of renal brush border enzymes at the Met-Val amide bond, and the radio-metabolite [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-Met-OH was rapidly excreted via the renal pathway with minimal kidney retention. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(HTK01166)-OH retained its PSMA-targeting capability and was also cleaved by NEP, although less effectively when compared to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(Ac)-OH. The kidney uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK(HTK01166)-OH was 30% less compared to that of [68Ga]Ga-HTK01166. Our data demonstrated that derivatives of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK-OH can be cleaved specifically by NEP, and therefore, MVK can be a promising cleavable linker for use to reduce kidney uptake of radiolabeled DOTA-conjugated peptides and peptidomimetics.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",32854201,[68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AmBz-MVK-OH,"68Ga-labeled DOTA-conjugated peptides",NEP,MVK,NULL
14223,"Tau PET Imaging with [18F]PM-PBB3 in Frontotemporal Dementia with MAPT Mutation.","BACKGROUND
Flortaucipir (AV-1451) and pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazole 3 (PBB3) are newly developed and commonly used positron emission tomography (PET) tracers to detect tau deposition in tauopathies, including frontotemporal dementia (FTD). [18F]PM-PBB3, as a second-generation compound, has not been described in FTD so far.


OBJECTIVE
We aim to explore the in vivo performance of [18F]PM-PBB3 tau PET in an FTD case caused by microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) mutation and compare the binding to different tau strains between AV-1451 and PBB3.


METHODS
We reported the clinical and FDG, [18F]AV45 amyloid and [18F]PM-PBB3 tau PET findings in a patient with FTD of P301L MAPT mutation. Based on our results and published data, we summarized and compared the different utilities of tau PET tracers of AV-1451 and PBB3 in FTD with MAPT mutation.


RESULTS
The patient demonstrated slightly diffuse [18F]PM-PBB3 tau deposition in cerebral lobes especially in the left frontal lobe overlapping with the hypometabolic region detected by FDG PET. From our analysis of 35 FTD patients with MAPT mutation who underwent tau PET, AV-1451 was positive in all (n = 11) patients with mutations known to cause three and four repeat (3R/4R) tau deposition and in 14.3% (n = 2/14) of 4R tauopathies, while positive PBB3 retention was found in all patients with both 3R/4R (n = 2) and 4R (n = 8) tau.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]PM-PBB3 tau PET assisted the diagnosis of FTD with P301L MAPT mutation, and might be useful in the in vivo detection of both 3R/4R and 4R tau domains in the brain of FTD with MAPT mutation.","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD",32444551,[18F]PM-PBB3,"[18F]AV45 amyloid",PBB3,NULL,NULL
37639,"Parametric methods for [18F]flortaucipir PET.","[18F]Flortaucipir is a PET tau tracer used to visualize tau binding in Alzheimer's disease (AD) in vivo. The present study evaluated the performance of several methods to obtain parametric images of [18F]flortaucipir. One hundred and thirty minutes dynamic PET scans were performed in 10 AD patients and 10 controls. Parametric images were generated using different linearization and basis function approaches. Regional binding potential (BPND) and volume of distribution (VT) values obtained from the parametric images were compared with corresponding values derived using the reversible two-tissue compartment model (2T4k_VB). Performance of SUVr parametric images was assessed by comparing values with distribution volume ratio (DVR) and SRTM-derived BPND estimates obtained using non-linear regression (NLR). Spectral analysis (SA) (r2 = 0.92; slope = 0.99) derived VT correlated well with NLR-derived VT. RPM (r2 = 0.95; slope = 0.98) derived BPND correlated well with NLR-derived DVR. Although SUVr80-100 min correlated well with NLR-derived DVR (r2 = 0.91; slope = 1.09), bias in SUVr appeared to depend on uptake time and underlying level of specific binding. In conclusion, RPM and SA provide parametric images comparable to the NLR estimates. Individual SUVr values are biased compared with DVR and this bias requires further study in a larger dataset in order to understand its consequences.","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism",30569813,[18F]Flortaucipir,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Imaging mGlu2 using positron emission tomography (PET) would allow for in vivo quantification under physiological and pathological conditions and facilitate drug discovery by enabling target engagement studies. In this paper, we aimed to develop a novel specific radioligand derived from negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) for PET imaging of mGlu2. Methods. A focused small molecule library of mGlu2 NAMs with tetrahydro naphthyridine scaffold was synthesized for pharmacology and physicochemical evaluation. GIRK dose-response assays and CNS panel binding selectivity assays were performed to study the affinity and selectivity of mGlu2 NAMs, among which compounds 14a and 14b were selected as PET ligand candidates. Autoradiography in SD rat brain sections was used to confirm the in vitro binding specificity and selectivity of [11C]14a and [11C]14b towards mGlu2. In vivo binding specificity was then studied by PET imaging. Whole body biodistribution study and radiometabolite analysis were conducted to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic properties of [11C]14b as most promising PET mGlu2 PET ligand. Results. mGlu2 NAMs 14a-14g were synthesized in 14%-20% yields in five steps. NAMs 14a and 14b were selected to be the most promising ligands due to their high affinity in GIRK dose-response assays. [11C]14a and [11C]14b displayed similar heterogeneous distribution by autoradiography, consistent with mGlu2 expression in the brain. While PET imaging study showed good brain permeability for both tracers, compound [11C]14b demonstrated superior binding specificity compared to [11C]14a. Further radiometabolite analysis of [11C]14b showed excellent stability in the brain. Conclusions. Compound 14b exhibited high affinity and excellent subtype selectivity, which was then evaluated by in vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET imaging study after labeling with carbon-11. Ligand [11C]14b, which we named [11C]MG2-1904, demonstrated high brain uptake and excellent in vitro/in vivo specific binding towards mGlu2 with high metabolic stability in the brain.

4,"Fluorine-18-Labeled PET Radiotracers for Imaging Tryptophan Uptake and Metabolism: a Systematic Review.","Due to its metabolism via the serotonin and kynurenine pathways, tryptophan plays a key role in multiple disease processes including cancer. Imaging tryptophan uptake and metabolism in vivo can be achieved with tryptophan derivative positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. While human studies with such tracers have been confined to C-11-labeled compounds, preclinical development of F-18-labeled tryptophan-based radiotracers has surged in recent years. We performed a systematic review of studies reporting on such F-18-labeled tryptophan tracers to summarize and compare their biological characteristics and their potential for tumor imaging, with a particular focus on key enzymes of the kynurenine pathway (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase [IDO] and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase [TDO]), which play an important role in tumoral immune resistance. From a PubMed search, English language articles including data on the preparation and radiochemical and/or biological characteristics of F-18-labeled tryptophan derivative radiotracers were reviewed. A total of 19 original papers included data on 15 unique radiotracers, the majority of which were synthesized with an adequate radiochemical yield. Automated synthesis was reported for 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan, the most extensively evaluated tracer thus far. Biodistribution studies showed high uptake in the pancreas, while the L-type amino acid transporter was the dominant transport mechanism for most of the reviewed tracers. Tracers tested for tumor uptake showed accumulation in tumor cell lines in vitro and in xenografts in vivo, often with favorable tumor-to-background uptake ratios in comparison with clinically used F-18-labeled radiotracers. Five tracers showed promise for imaging IDO activity, including 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan and a F-18-labeled analog of alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan tested clinically in previous studies. Two radiotracers were metabolized by TDO but showed defluorination in vivo. In summary, most F-18-labeled tryptophan derivative PET tracers share common transport mechanisms and biodistribution characteristics. Several reported tracers could be candidates for further testing and validation toward PET imaging applications in a variety of human diseases.","Molecular imaging and biology",31512038,1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tryptophan,"F-18-labeled tryptophan",TDO,NULL,"tumor cell lines"

The mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of the primary tumor was compared with the clinical characteristics, and the relationships between SUV and progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) were analyzed. Results: 18F-FES SUV significantly associated with stage, histology, lymphovascular space involvement (LVSI), and lymph node metastasis; and 18F-FDG SUV significantly associated with stage, myometrial invasion, tumor size, and lymph node metastasis. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that 18F-FES SUV could significantly detect tumor progression and survival with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813 and 0.790, respectively; whereas 18F-FDG SUV could detect them with AUC of 0.557 and 0.635. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that patients with low 18F-FES SUV had significantly poor PFS (p<0.001) and OS (P = 0.001) compared with patients with high SUV, whereas 18F-FDG showed no significant differences. In a sub-analysis of 27 patients with low risk of recurrence (FIGO stage IA endometrioid carcinoma [grade 1 or 2] without LVSI, those with low 18F-FES SUV also had poorer PFS) than those with high SUV (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, 18F-FES SUV <2.63 (P = 0.037, hazard ratio (HR) 10.727, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-99.35), and FIGO stages III and IV (P = 0.042, HR 8.838, 95%CI 1.09-71.84) were significantly associated with PFS. Conclusion: Low pretreatment 18F-FES SUV of the primary tumor associated strongly with prognostic factors of EC such as LVSI and lymph node metastasis, and low 18F-FES SUV was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in patients with EC.

To compare the diagnostic efficiency of 68Gallium labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (68Ga-PSMA PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for staging the lymph node metastases (LNMs) in the prostate cancer.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A broad search of scientific databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database, and Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (updated prior to November 1st, 2018) was conducted systematically by two reviewers. In this paper, we evaluated the methodological quality of each included article independently and performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to reveal the summary of the diagnostic performance of 68Ga-PSMA PET and MRI in properly identifying LNMs of intermediate- and/or high-risk prostate cancer.


RESULTS
Thirteen eligible articles comprising 1,597 patients were included. For LNMs detection, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of 68Ga-PSMA PET were 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49-0.79) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.88-0.97), respectively, while the corresponding values of MRI were 0.41 (95% CI: 0.26-0.57) and 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86-0.95). The area under the symmetric receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve for 68Ga-PSMA PET and MRI were 0.92 and 0.83, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
In intermediate- or high-risk pre-treatment prostate cancer, 68Ga-PSMA PET had a higher sensitivity and a slightly different specificity in probing the LNMs when comparing with MRI. Moreover, the area under the SROC curve indicated that 68Ga-PSMA PET was a more effective weapon for predicting the LNMs prior to radical surgery.","The world journal of men's health",31081294,"68Ga-PSMA PET","68Gallium labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen",NULL,NULL,NULL

Given the requirements of high sensitivity and spatial resolution, the development of new positron emission tomography (PET) agents is required for PET renography. The objective of this study was to investigate a new fluorine-18 labeled hippurate analogue of picolinamide, N-(6-[18F]Fluoropyridin-3-yl)glycine, as a new renal PET agent for evaluating renal function.


METHODS
N-(6-[18F]Fluoropyridin-3-yl)glycine was prepared via a two-step reaction, including the nucleophilic substitution reaction of Br with 18F using methyl 2-(6-bromonicotinamido)acetate as a precursor followed the hydrolysis with sodium hydroxide and purification by preparative-HPLC.

This study was undertaken to evaluate radiation dosimetry for the prostate-specific membrane antigen targeted [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 radiopharmaceutical, and to initially assess agent performance in positron emission tomography (PET) detection of the site of disease in prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical recurrence.


PROCEDURES
Under IND 133,222 and an IRB-approved research protocol, we evaluated the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 with serial PET imaging following intravenous administration to ten prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence. The recruited subjects were all patients in whom a recent [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) exam had been independently performed under IND 131,806 to assist in decision-making with regard to their clinical care. Voided urine was collected from each subject at ~ 60 min and ~ 140 min post-[68Ga]Ga-P16-093 injection and assayed for Ga-68 content. Following image segmentation to extract tissue time-activity curves and corresponding cumulated activity values, radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated using IDAC Dose 2.1. The prior [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT exam (whole-body PET imaging at 60 min post-injection, performed with contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT) served as a reference scan for comparison to the [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 findings.


RESULTS
[68Ga]Ga-P16-093 PET images at 60 min post-injection provided diagnostic information that appeared equivalent to the subject's prior [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 scan. With both radiopharmaceuticals, sites of tumor recurrence were found in eight of the ten patients, identifying 16 lesions. The site of recurrence was not detected with either agent for the other two subjects. Bladder activity was consistently lower with [68Ga]Ga-P16-093 than [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. The kidneys, spleen, salivary glands, and liver receive the highest radiation exposure from [68Ga]Ga-P16-093, with estimated doses of 1.7 × 10-1, 6.7 × 10-2, 6.5 × 10-2, and 5.6 × 10-2 mGy/MBq, respectively.

It was earlier reported that cyclodextrin derivatives have a high affinity to form complexes with PGE2. Based on these results radiolabeled cyclodextrins - as new radiopharmaceuticals - may open a new pathway in the in vivo imaging and diagnosis of PGE2 positive tumors. The aims of this study were to synthetize the PGE2 specific 68Ga-labeled NODAGA-randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (68Ga-NODAGA-RAMEB) and investigate its tumor-targeting properties.

Biodistribution studies showed high accumulation of 68Ga-NODAGA-RAMEB in PGE2 positive BxPC-3 tumors; approximately 15-20-fold higher radiotracer uptake was observed, than that of the background. 68Ga-labeled RAMEB is a promising radiotracer in PET diagnostics of PGE2 positive tumors.","International journal of pharmaceutics",31935470,68Ga-NODAGA-RAMEB,"68Ga-labeled RAMEB",RCP%,NULL,BxPC-3
335,"A Novel PET Probe for Brown Adipose Tissue Imaging in Rodents.","PURPOSE
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has emerged as a promising target to counteract obesity and its associated metabolic disorders. However, the detection of this tissue remains one of the major roadblocks.


PROCEDURES
In this study, we assess the use of BODIPY 1 as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent to image BAT depots in vivo in two mouse phenotypes: obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and the obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. [18F]BODIPY 1 is a radioactive dye that processed both radioactivity for PET imaging and fluorescence signal for in vitro mechanism study.


RESULTS
Through the co-staining of cancer cells with BODIPY 1 and MitoTracker, we found BODIPY 1 mainly accumulated in cell mitochondria in vitro. Fluorescence imaging of primary brown and white adipocytes further confirmed BODIPY 1 had significantly higher accumulation in primary brown adipocytes compared with primary white adipocytes. We evaluated [18F]BODIPY 1 for BAT imaging in both obesity-resistant BALB/c mice and obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. Indeed, [18F]BODIPY 1 was efficiently taken up by BAT in both mouse genotypes (6.40 ± 1.98 %ID/g in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice (n = 8) and 5.37 ± 0.82 %ID/g in obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice (n = 7)). Although norepinephrine stimulation could increase the absolute BAT uptake, the enhancement is not significant in both genotypes (p > 0.05) at current sample size. These results suggest BAT uptake of [18F]BODIPY 1 may be independent of BAT thermogenic activity. As a comparison, 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) PET imaging was performed in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice. Significantly increased uptake was observed in adrenergically activated BAT (10.08 ± 2.52 %ID/g, n = 3) but not in inactive BAT (3.803 ± 0.70 %ID/g; n = 3). Because [18F]BODIPY 1 maintained its fluorescent property, BAT tissue was excised and studied using fluorescence microscopy. Strong fluorescence signal was observed in BAT mouse that was injected with BODIPY 1.


CONCLUSIONS
Unlike [18F]FDG, [18F]BODIPY 1 showed prominent accumulation in BAT under both inactive and stimulated status. [18F]BODIPY 1 may serve as a valuable BAT PET agent to possibly assess BAT mitochondria density, thus BAT thermogenic capacity after further evaluation.","Molecular imaging and biology",31520279,"[18F]BODIPY 1","[18F]BODIPY 1",NULL,NULL,NULL
42906,"Relationship between the expression of oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor and 18F-FDG uptake in endometrial cancer.","BACKGROUND
Progestogens have been widely used for the treatment of inoperable endometrial cancer or younger patients with endometrial cancer. Identifying markers that are predictive of a response to progestogens is critical for successful therapy. Molecular imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) can provide metabolic phenotypic information of many malignancies. We investigated whether estrogen receptor (ER)/progestogen receptor (PR) status is correlated with 18F-FDG uptake, and whether 18F-FDG PET/CT could be useful for predicting ER/PR status in endometrial cancer.


RESULTS
Endometrial cancers in the ER-positive group had lower SUVmax than those in the ER-negative group (12.3 ± 6.2 vs. 19.9 ± 6.6, respectively; P = 0.003). Endometrial cancers in the PR-positive group also had lower SUVmax than those in the PR-negative group (12.4 ± 6.2 vs. 20.0 ± 6.9, respectively; P = 0.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that SUVmax and tumour differentiation grade were significantly associated with both ER and PR status (P = 0.027 and P = 0.044, respectively). ER expression was predicted with an accuracy of 74.2% when a SUVmax value of 15.3 was used as a cutoff point for analysis. Similarly, PR expression was predicted with an accuracy of 74.2%, when a SUVmax value of 15.95 was used as the threshold for analysis.


CONCLUSION
Higher 18F-FDG accumulation in endometrial cancers is correlated with negative ER/PR expression. 18F-FDG PET/CT may be used to predict the status of ER/PR and thus aid in optimal treatment decision in endometrial cancers.


METHODS
We carried out a retrospective analysis on 62 endometrial cancer patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before radical treatment. The maximum of standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was calculated from the 18F-FDG accumulation of the primary tumor.

Recently, the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) tracers like 68Ga-PSMA-11 in positron emission tomography (PET) have shown promising results and are helping to improve care for patients with prostate cancer (PC).


PURPOSE
In the following we review the current literature on PSMA-ligand PET, in particular with regard to the currently increasing replacement of 68Ga-PSMA ligands by 18F-labeled PSMA ligands.


RESULTS
PSMA-ligand PET is most frequently used for biochemical recurrence. Here, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT shows superior detection rates compared to conventional imaging modalities, especially in small, morphologically unsuspicious lesions, even at low PSA values. Furthermore, 68Ga-PSMA PET imaging seems to be an encouraging alternative for staging of high-risk patients, particularly in combination with multiparametric MRI.


CONCLUSION
The use of PSMA-ligand PET has revolutionized PC imaging. Thus, PSMA-ligand PET is expected to play an even greater role in PC diagnostics in the future, especially as 18F-labeled PSMA ligands are now increasingly used. However, simultaneous image analysis of PET and CT as well as a differentiated image evaluation (clinical context, knowledge of common pitfalls) is mandatory.","Der Radiologe",31996945,68Ga-PSMA,"18F-labeled PSMA ligands",PSA,NULL,NULL
50234,"Fast and efficient copper-mediated 18F-fluorination of arylstannanes, aryl boronic acids, and aryl boronic esters without azeotropic drying.","BACKGROUND
Copper-mediated radiofluorination is a straightforward method to produce a variety of [18F]fluoroarenes and [18F]fluoroheteroarenes. To minimize the number of steps in the production of 18F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, we have developed a short and efficient azeotropic drying-free 18F-labelling method using copper-mediated fluorination. Our goal was to improve the copper-mediated method to achieve wide substrate scope with good radiochemical yields with short synthesis time.


RESULTS
Solid phase extraction with Cu (OTf)2 in dimethylacetamide is a suitable activation method for [18F]fluoride. Elution efficiency with Cu (OTf)2 is up to 79% and radiochemical yield (RCY) of a variety of model molecules in the crude reaction mixture has reached over 90%. Clinically relevant molecules, norepinephrine transporter tracer [18F]NS12137 and monoamine transporter tracer [18F]CFT were produced with 16.5% RCY in 98 min and 5.3% RCY in 64 min, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
Cu (OTf)2 is a suitable elution agent for releasing [18F]fluoride from an anion exchange cartridge. The method is fast and efficient and the Cu-complex is customizable after the release of [18F]fluoride. Alterations in the [18F]fluoride elution techniques did not have a negative effect on the subsequent labelling reactions. We anticipate this improved [18F]fluoride elution technique to supplant the traditional azeotropic drying of [18F]fluoride in the long run and to concurrently enable the variations of the copper-complex.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",31659523,[18F]fluoride,"18F-labelled radiopharmaceuticals",NULL,NULL,NULL

The objective of this study was to develop a quick automatic method for synthesis of solvent-free 16α-[18F]FES using a CFN-MPS-200 synthesis system and compare the catalytic efficiency of two phase transfer catalysts, Kryptofix 222/K2CO3 (K222/K2CO3) and tetrabutylammonium hydrogen carbonate (TBA·HCO3). In this method, phase transfer catalysts K222/K2CO3 and TBA·HCO3 were used, respectively. The intermediate products were both hydrolyzed with hydrochloric acid and neutralized with sodium bicarbonate. The crude product was purified with semi-preparative HPLC, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The effects of radiofluorination temperature and time on the synthesis were also investigated. Radiochemical purity of solvent-free product was above 99% and the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 16α-[18F]FES was obtained in 48.7 ± 0.95% (catalyzed by K222/K2CO3, n = 4) and 46.7 ± 0.77% (catalyzed by TBA·HCO3, n = 4, respectively).

Accurate diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis and sarcoidosis is particularly important because cardiac involvement can be fatal. Amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils, and cardiac amyloidosis is classified into amyloid immunoglobulin light chain (AL) and amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) types. Radionuclide tracers for amyloidosis include (a) bone tracers, (b) amyloid-directed molecules, and (c) PET amyloid agents. Bone tracers are particularly sensitive in detection of ATTR type amyloidosis, whereas PET amyloid agents show a higher affinity for the AL type. In sarcoidosis, gallium 67 (67Ga) citrate scintigraphy and fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET are pivotal to diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis, and 18F-FDG PET/CT has particularly high efficacy in detection of sarcoidosis and monitoring of response to therapy.

Herein we report validation of the synthesis of [18F]NML for clinical use by labeling the trifluoromethyl group via radiofluorination of the corresponding gem-difluoro enol ether precursor. This is the first use of this method for clinical production of PET radiotracers and confirmed that it can be readily implemented at multiple production facilities to provide [18F]NML in good noncorrected radiochemical yield (3.4 ± 1.5 GBq, 4.6% ± 2.6%) and molar activity (120.1 ± 186.3 GBq/μmol), excellent radiochemical purity (>97%), and suitable for human use (n = 15). With [18F]NML in hand, we conducted rodent biodistribution, estimates of human dosimetry, and preliminary evaluation of [18F]NML in human subjects at two imaging sites. Healthy controls (n = 4) and mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) AD patients (n = 6) received [18F]NML (tau), [18F]AV1451 (tau), and [18F]florbetaben or [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) PET scans. A single progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patient also received [18F]NML and [18F]AV1451 PET scans. [18F]NML showed good brain uptake, reasonable pharmacokinetics, and appropriate imaging characteristics in healthy controls. The mean ± SD of the administered mass of [18F/19F]NML was 2.01 ± 2.17 μg (range, 0.16-8.27 μg) and the mean administered activity was 350 ± 62 MBq (range, 199-403 MBq). There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 11 subjects, and no significant changes in vital signs were observed. However, despite high affinity for tau in vitro, brain retention in MCI/AD and PSP patients was low, and there was no evidence of specific signals in vivo that corresponded to tau. Although it is still unclear why clinical translation of the radiotracer was unsuccessful, we nevertheless conclude that further development of [18F]NML as a tau PET imaging agent is not warranted at this time.","ACS chemical neuroscience",31898886,[18F]NML,[18F]NML),NULL,NULL,NULL

Affibody molecules are so-called scaffold proteins with favorable biophysical properties, such as a small size for improved tissue penetration and extravasation, thermal and chemical stability, and a high tolerance to modifications. Additionally, affibody molecules are efficiently produced in prokaryotic hosts or by chemical peptide synthesis.

We searched for relevant articles in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and Web of Science until September 12, 2019. Studies regarding the diagnostic performance of68Ga-PSMA PET/MRI in detecting primary PCa and biochemical recurrence (BCR) after definitive treatment were included. The quality of each study was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET/MRI in identifying primary PCa and the pooled detection rate of PET/MRI for BCR were calculated using a random-effects model.


RESULTS
A total of 13 studies with 707 patients were included in the analysis, and the pooled sensitivity and specificity of PET/MRI in detecting primary PCa were 0.83 (95 % CI, 0.73-0.90) and 0.81 (95 % CI, 0.61-0.93), respectively.

70906,"Thoracic positron emission tomography: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and beyond.","Ongoing technologic and therapeutic advancements in medicine are now testing the limits of conventional anatomic imaging techniques. The ability to image physiology, rather than simply anatomy, is critical in the management of multiple disease processes, especially in oncology. Nuclear medicine has assumed a leading role in detecting, diagnosing, staging and assessing treatment response of various pathologic entities, and appears well positioned to do so into the future. When combined with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) has become the sine quo non technique of evaluating most solid tumors especially in the thorax. PET/CT serves as a key imaging modality in the initial evaluation of pulmonary nodules, often obviating the need for more invasive testing. PET/CT is essential to staging and restaging in bronchogenic carcinoma and offers key physiologic information with regard to treatment response. A more recent development, PET/MRI, shows promise in several specific lung cancer applications as well. Additional recent advancements in the field have allowed PET to expand beyond imaging with 18F-flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) alone, now with the ability to specifically image certain types of cell surface receptors. In the thorax this predominantly includes 68Ga-DOTATATE which targets the somatostatin receptors abundantly expressed in neuroendocrine tumors, including bronchial carcinoid. This receptor targeted imaging technique permits targeting these tumors with therapeutic analogues such as 177Lu labeled DOTATATE. Overall, the proper utilization of PET in the thorax has the ability to directly impact and improve patient care.","Journal of thoracic disease",33282403,68Ga-DOTATATE,"177Lu labeled DOTATATE","somatostatin receptors",NULL,NULL
404,"Simultaneous PET/MRI in the Evaluation of Breast and Prostate Cancer Using Combined Na[18F] F and [18F]FDG: a Focus on Skeletal Lesions.","PURPOSE
The purpose of this study is to prospectively evaluate the performance of sodium 18F]fluoride (Na[18F]F)/2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) simultaneous time-of-flight enabled positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the detection of skeletal metastases in selected patients with advanced breast and prostate cancers.


PROCEDURE
The institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant protocol. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. A total of 74 patients (23 women and 51 men with breast and prostate cancer, respectively) referred for standard-of-care whole-body bone scintigraphy (WBBS) were enrolled in this prospective study. All patients underwent a [99mTc]methyldiphosphonate ([99mTc]MDP) WBBS followed by Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI. Lesions detected by each imaging modality were tabulated and a lesion-based and patient-based analysis was conducted.


RESULTS
On a patient-based analysis, [99mTc]MDP WBBS identified skeletal lesions in 37 patients and PET/MRI in 45 patients. On a lesion-based analysis, WBBS identified a total of 81 skeletal lesions, whereas PET/MRI identified 140 lesions. Additionally, PET/MRI showed extra-skeletal lesions in 19 patients, including lymph nodes (16), prostate (4) lung (3), and liver (2) lesions.


CONCLUSIONS
The ability of Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI to identify more skeletal lesions than 99mTc-MDP WBBS and to additionally identify extra-skeletal disease may be beneficial for patient care and represent an alternative to the single modalities performed separately. Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG PET/MRI is a promising approach for evaluation of skeletal and extra-skeletal lesions in a selected population of breast and prostate cancer patients.","Molecular imaging and biology",31236756,Na[18F]F/[18F]FDG,"sodium 18F]fluoride (Na[18F]F)/2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose",NULL,NULL,NULL

68916,"Development of a fluorine-18 radiolabelled fluorescent chalcone: evaluated for detecting glycogen.","BACKGROUND
Glycogen is a multibranched polysaccharide of glucose produced by cells to store energy and plays a key role in cancer. A previously reported fluorescent probe (CDg4) was shown to selectively bind glycogen in mouse embryonic stem cells, however the molecule was not evaluated in cancer cells. We report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a dual-modality imaging probe based on CDg4, for positron emission tomography (PET) and fluorescence microscopy.


RESULTS
A fluorine-18 radiolabelled derivative of CDg4, ([18F]5) for in vivo quantification of total glycogen levels in cancer cells was developed and synthesised in 170 min with a non-decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY n.d.c) of 5.1 ± 0.9% (n = 4) in > 98% radiochemical purity. Compound 5 and [18F]5 were evaluated in vitro for their potential to bind glycogen, but only 5 showed accumulation by fluorescence microscopy. The accumulation of 5 was determined to be specific as fluorescent signal diminished upon the digestion of carbohydrate polymers with α-amylase. PET imaging in non-tumour bearing mice highlighted rapid hepato-biliary-intestinal elimination of [18F]5 and almost complete metabolic degradation after 60 min in the liver, plasma and urine, confirmed by radioactive metabolite analysis.


CONCLUSIONS
Fluorescent compound 5 selectively accumulated in glycogen containing cancer cells, identified by fluorescence microscopy; however, rapid in vivo metabolic degradation precludes further investigation of [18F]5 as a PET radiopharmaceutical.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",32578021,[18F]5,"fluorine-18 radiolabelled derivative",α-amylase,NULL,NULL

25629,"From metabolic connectivity to molecular connectivity: application to dopaminergic pathways.","INTRODUCTION
This study aims to reveal the feasibility and potential of molecular connectivity based on neurotransmission in comparison with the metabolic connectivity with an application to dopaminergic pathways. For this purpose, we propose to compare the neurotransmission connectivity findings using 123I-FP-CIT SPECT and 18F-FDOPA PET with the metabolic connectivity findings using 18F-FDG PET.


METHODS
18F-FDG PET and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT images from 47 subjects and 18F-FDOPA PET images from 177 subjects, who had no neurological or psychiatric disorders, were studied. Interregional correlation analyses were performed at the group level to determine the midbrain's connectivity via glucose metabolic rate using 18F-FDG PET and via dopaminergic binding potential using 123I-FP-CIT SPECT and 18F-FDOPA PET. SPM-T maps of each radiotracer were generated, and masks used to highlight the significant differences obtained among the imaging modalities and targets.


RESULTS
The three dopaminergic pathways (i.e., nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical) were identified by 18F-FDG PET (1599 voxels, with a Tmax value of 12.6), 123I-FP-CIT SPECT (1120 voxels, with Tmax value of 5.1), and 18F-FDOPA PET (6054 voxels, with Tmax value of 11.7) for a T voxel threshold of 5.10, 2.80, and 5.10, respectively. Using the same T voxel threshold of 5.10, 18F-FDOPA PET showed more specific findings than 18F-FDG PET with less voxels identified outside these pathways (- 9323 voxels), whereas no significant voxels were obtained with 123I-FP-CIT SPECT at this threshold.


CONCLUSION
The present study illustrates the feasibility and interest in using molecular connectivity with 18F-FDOPA PET for dopaminergic pathways.

27223,"Automated radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH for PET imaging of GnRH receptor-positive tumors.","INTRODUCTION
Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor is overexpressed in many human tumors. Previously we developed a 18F-labelled GnRH peptide. Although the GnRH-targeted PET probe can be clearly visualized by microPET imaging in a PC-3 xenograft model, clinical applications of the probe have been limited by complex labeling procedures, poor radiochemical yield, and unwanted accumulation in GnRH receptor negative tissues. In this study, we have designed a new 18F-labelled GnRH peptide that is more amenable to clinical development.


METHODS
GnRH peptide analogues NOTA-P-GnRH was synthesized and automated radiolabeled with 18F using a Al[18F]F complex on a modified PET-MF-2V-IT-I synthesis module. The GnRH receptor affinities of AlF-NOTA-P-GnRH and NOTA-P-GnRH were determined by in vitro competitive binding assay. For in vitro characterization determination of stability and partition coefficients were carried out, respectively. Dynamic microPET and biodistribution studies of Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH were evaluated in xenograft tumor mouse models.


RESULTS
The total radiochemical synthesis and purification of Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH was completed within 35 min with a decay-corrected yield of 35 ± 10%. The logP value of Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH was -2.74 ± 0.04 and the tracer was stable in phosphate-buffered saline, and bovine and human serum. The IC50 values of AlF-NOTA-P-GnRH and NOTA-P-GnRH were 116 nM and 56.2 nM, respectively. Dynamic PET imaging together with ex vivo biodistribution analyses revealed that Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH was clearly delineated in both PC-3 and MDA-MB-231 xenografted tumors.


CONCLUSION
Al[18F]F-NOTA-P-GnRH can be efficiently produced on a commercially available automated synthesis module and has potential for use in clinical diagnosis of GnRH receptor-positive tumors.

The present study aims to compare the diagnostic efficacy of MR, 18F-FDG PET/CT, and 18F-FDG PET/MR for the local detection of early-stage extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL).


Patients and Methods
Thirty-six patients with histologically proven early-stage ENKTL were enrolled from a phase 2 study (Cohort A). Eight nasopharyngeal anatomical regions from each patient were imaged using 18F-FDG PET/CT and MR. A further nine patients were prospectively enrolled from a multicenter, phase 3 study; these patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and PET/MR after a single 18F-FDG injection (Cohort B). Region-based sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The standardized uptake values (SUV) obtained from PET/CT and PET/MR were compared, and the relationship between the SUV and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) of PET/MR were analyzed.


Results
In Cohort A, of the 288 anatomic regions, 86 demonstrated lymphoma involvement. All lesions were detected by 18F-FDG PET/CT, while only 70 were detected by MR. 18F-FDG PET/CT exhibited a higher sensitivity than MR (100% vs. 81.4%, χ2 = 17.641, P < 0.001) for local detection of malignancies. The specificity of 18F-FDG PET/CT and MR were 98.5 and 97.5%, respectively (χ2 = 0.510, P = 0.475). The accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT was 99.0% and the accuracy of MR was 92.7% (χ2 = 14.087, P < 0.001). In Cohort B, 72 anatomical regions were analyzed. PET/CT and PET/MR have a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.5%. The two methods were consistent (κ = 0.833, P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between PET/MR SUVmax and PET/CT SUVmax (r = 0.711, P < 0.001), and SUVmean (r = 0.685, P < 0.001). No correlation was observed between the SUV and the ADC.

48359,"18F-FAC PET Visualizes Brain-Infiltrating Leukocytes in a Mouse Model of Multiple Sclerosis.","Brain-infiltrating leukocytes contribute to multiple sclerosis (MS) and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and likely play a role in traumatic brain injury, seizure, and stroke. Brain-infiltrating leukocytes are also primary targets for MS disease-modifying therapies. However, no method exists for noninvasively visualizing these cells in a living organism. 1-(2'-deoxy-2'-18F-fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine (18F-FAC) is a PET radiotracer that measures deoxyribonucleoside salvage and accumulates preferentially in immune cells. We hypothesized that 18F-FAC PET could noninvasively image brain-infiltrating leukocytes. Methods: Healthy mice were imaged with 18F-FAC PET to quantify if this radiotracer crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a mouse disease model with brain-infiltrating leukocytes. To determine whether 18F-FAC accumulates in brain-infiltrating leukocytes, EAE mice were analyzed with 18F-FAC PET, digital autoradiography, and immunohistochemistry, and deoxyribonucleoside salvage activity in brain-infiltrating leukocytes was analyzed ex vivo. Fingolimod-treated EAE mice were imaged with 18F-FAC PET to assess if this approach can monitor the effect of an immunomodulatory drug on brain-infiltrating leukocytes. PET scans of individuals injected with 2-chloro-2'-deoxy-2'-18F-fluoro-9-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-adenine (18F-CFA), a PET radiotracer that measures deoxyribonucleoside salvage in humans, were analyzed to evaluate whether 18F-CFA crosses the human BBB. Results: 18F-FAC accumulates in the healthy mouse brain at levels similar to 18F-FAC in the blood (2.54 ± 0.2 and 3.04 ± 0.3 percentage injected dose per gram, respectively) indicating that 18F-FAC crosses the BBB. EAE mice accumulate 18F-FAC in the brain at 180% of the levels of control mice. Brain 18F-FAC accumulation localizes to periventricular regions with significant leukocyte infiltration, and deoxyribonucleoside salvage activity is present at similar levels in brain-infiltrating T and innate immune cells. These data suggest that 18F-FAC accumulates in brain-infiltrating leukocytes in this model. Fingolimod-treated EAE mice accumulate 18F-FAC in the brain at 37% lower levels than control-treated EAE mice, demonstrating that 18F-FAC PET can monitor therapeutic interventions in this mouse model. 18F-CFA accumulates in the human brain at 15% of blood levels (0.08 ± 0.01 and 0.54 ± 0.07 SUV, respectively), indicating that 18F-CFA does not cross the BBB in humans. Conclusion: 18F-FAC PET can visualize brain-infiltrating leukocytes in a mouse MS model and can monitor the response of these cells to an immunomodulatory drug. Translating this strategy into humans will require exploring additional radiotracers.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31653711,"18F-FAC PET","1-(2'-deoxy-2'-18F-fluoroarabinofuranosyl) cytosine",NULL,NULL,NULL
72489,"Kinetic Modeling and Test-Retest Reproducibility of 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP, Novel Agonist Radiotracers for PET Imaging of the κ-Opioid Receptor in Humans.","The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) is implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously evaluated an agonist tracer, 11C-GR103545, for PET imaging of KOR in humans. Although 11C-GR103545 showed high brain uptake, good binding specificity, and selectivity for KOR, it displayed slow kinetics and relatively large test-retest variability of total distribution volume (V T) estimates (15%). Therefore, we set out to develop 2 novel KOR agonist radiotracers, 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP. In nonhuman primates, both tracers exhibited faster kinetics than 11C-GR103545 and comparable binding parameters to 11C-GR103545. The aim of this study was to assess their kinetic and binding properties in humans. Methods: Six healthy subjects underwent 120-min test-retest PET scans with both 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP. Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time-activity curves were generated for 14 regions of interest. One-tissue-compartment and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method were applied to the regional time-activity curves to calculate V T The time stability of V T and test-retest reproducibility were evaluated. Levels of specific binding, as measured by the nondisplaceable binding potential (BP ND) for the 3 tracers (11C-EKAP, 11C-FEKAP, and 11C-GR103545), were compared using a graphical method. Results: For both tracers, regional time-activity curves were fitted well with the 2TC model and MA1 method (t* = 20 min) but not with the 1-tissue-compartment model. Given the unreliably estimated parameters in several fits with the 2TC model and a good V T match between MA1 and 2TC, MA1 was chosen as the appropriate model for both tracers. Mean MA1 V T was highest for 11C-GR103545, followed by 11C-EKAP and then 11C-FEKAP. The minimum scan time for stable V T measurement was 90 and 110 min for 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP, respectively, compared with 140 min for 11C-GR103545. The mean absolute test-retest variability in MA1 V T estimates was 7% and 18% for 11C-EKAP and 11C-FEKAP, respectively. BP ND levels were similar for 11C-FEKAP and 11C-GR103545 but were about 25% lower for 11C-EKAP. Conclusion: The 2 novel KOR agonist tracers showed faster tissue kinetics than 11C-GR103545. Even with a slightly lower BP ND, 11C-EKAP is judged to be a better tracer for imaging and quantification of KOR in humans, on the basis of the shorter minimum scan time and the excellent test-retest reproducibility of regional V T.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",32169917,11C-EKAP,"11C-FEKAP and 11C-GR103545",KOR,NULL,"MA1 V T"
72731,"Imaging-based target volume reduction in chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (PET-Plan): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial.","BACKGROUND
With increasingly precise radiotherapy and advanced medical imaging, the concept of radiotherapy target volume planning might be redefined with the aim of improving outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether target volume reduction is feasible and effective compared with conventional planning in the context of radical chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.


METHODS
We did a multicentre, open-label, randomised, controlled trial (PET-Plan; ARO-2009-09) in 24 centres in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Previously untreated patients (aged older than 18 years) with inoperable locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer suitable for chemoradiotherapy and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of less than 3 were included. Undergoing 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET and CT for treatment planning, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a random number generator and block sizes between four and six to target volume delineation informed by 18F-FDG PET and CT plus elective nodal irradiation (conventional target group) or target volumes informed by PET alone (18F-FDG PET-based target group). Randomisation was stratified by centre and Union for International Cancer Control stage. In both groups, dose-escalated radiotherapy (60-74 Gy, 2 Gy per fraction) was planned to the respective target volumes and applied with concurrent platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was time to locoregional progression from randomisation with the objective to test non-inferiority of 18F-FDG PET-based planning with a prespecified hazard ratio (HR) margin of 1·25. The per-protocol set was included in the primary analysis. The safety set included all patients receiving any study-specific treatment. Patients and study staff were not masked to treatment assignment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00697333.


FINDINGS
From May 13, 2009, to Dec 5, 2016, 205 of 311 recruited patients were randomly assigned to the conventional target group (n=99) or the 18F-FDG PET-based target group (n=106; the intention-to-treat set), and 172 patients were treated per protocol (84 patients in the conventional target group and 88 in the 18F-FDG PET-based target group). At a median follow-up of 29 months (IQR 9-54), the risk of locoregional progression in the 18F-FDG PET-based target group was non-inferior to, and in fact lower than, that in the conventional target group in the per-protocol set (14% [95% CI 5-21] vs 29% [17-38] at 1 year; HR 0·57 [95% CI 0·30-1·06]). The risk of locoregional progression in the 18F-FDG PET-based target group was also non-inferior to that in the conventional target group in the intention-to-treat set (17% [95% CI 9-24] vs 30% [20-39] at 1 year; HR 0·64 [95% CI 0·37-1·10]). The most common acute grade 3 or worse toxicity was oesophagitis or dysphagia (16 [16%] of 99 patients in the conventional target group vs 17 [16%] of 105 patients in the 18F-FDG PET-based target group); the most common late toxicities were lung-related (12 [12%] vs 11 [10%]). 20 deaths potentially related to study treatment were reported (seven vs 13).


INTERPRETATION
18F-FDG PET-based planning could potentially improve local control and does not seem to increase toxicity in patients with chemoradiotherapy-treated locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Imaging-based target volume reduction in this setting is, therefore, feasible, and could potentially be considered standard of care. The procedures established might also support imaging-based target volume reduction concepts for other tumours.

Evaluation of [68Ga]NODAGA-duramycin as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer of cell death for whole-body detection of chemotherapy-induced organ toxicity.


PROCEDURES
Tracer specificity of Ga-68 labeled NODAGA-duramycin was determined in vitro using competitive binding experiments. Organ uptake was analyzed in untreated and doxorubicin, busulfan, and cisplatin-treated mice 2 h after intravenous injection of [68Ga]NODAGA-duramycin. In vivo data were validated by immunohistology and blood parameters.


RESULTS
In vitro experiments confirmed specific binding of [68Ga]NODAGA-duramycin. Organ toxicities were detected successfully using [68Ga]NODAGA-duramycin PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) and confirmed by immunohistochemistry and blood parameter analysis. Organ toxicities in livers and kidneys showed similar trends in PET/CT and immunohistology.

All patients underwent 68Ga-NEB and 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 PET/CT imaging. Visual analysis of 68Ga-NEB PET/CT images was used to determine SLNs, and then compared with the 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 results and histopathological findings. SLNs were visualized in 24 of 24 patients (100.0%) within 4.0-10.0 (5.6 ± 1.4) min. All patients were pathologically diagnosed with breast cancer, and 12 patients had ipsilateral lymph node metastasis. By combining 68Ga-NEB and 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 images, 7/12 (58.3%) patients showed mild to intense uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 in SLNs, 1/12 patient (8.3%) had moderate uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 in the non-SLNs rather than SLN, indicating possible bypass lymphatic drainage, partially accounting for the false negatives in SLN biopsy during surgery. No false positives were found. The SUVmax of 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 activity in metastatic SLNs was significantly higher than that in non-metastatic SLNs (2.2 ± 2.3 vs 0.7 ± 0.1, P = 0.047). This study manifests the value of combination of 68Ga-NEB and 68Ga-NOTA-RM26 dual tracer PET/CT in preoperative evaluation of SLN metastasis in breast cancer patients, especially in those patients with lymphatic obstruction and bypass drainage.

A list-mode acquisition was used to generate a 20-min image set as a reference (PETSTD) and to simulate a low-dose injection with a 10-min image (PETLD). We tested the reproducibility between PETLD and PETSTD with a blinded visual interpretation by two nuclear physicians asked to classify metabolic patterns, and a quantitative analysis conducted with regions-of-interest. Voxelwise comparisons between patients suggestive of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) were also conducted.


RESULTS
The intra-operator agreement was high between the PETSTD and PETLD visual assessments for both readers (kappa 0.92 and 0.99). SUV ratios were strongly reproducible (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.95). The voxelwise and regional comparisons between AD vs. FTD metabolic profiles yielded very similar results with PETSTD and PETLD.


CONCLUSIONS
A reduction of the [18F]FDG dose down to 1 MBq/kg is possible when performing 20-min brain PET/MRI without modifying diagnostic performance and quantitative assessments. The advantage is a significant reduction in the patient effective dose, which is non-negligible in longitudinal follow-up studies and in research protocols involving healthy volunteers.","Molecular imaging and biology",31286349,[18F]FDG,[18F]FDG),PETLD,NULL,NULL

N-(3,4-Dimethylisoxazol-5-yl)piperazine-4-[4-(2-fluoro-4-[11C]methylphenyl)thiazol-2-yl]-1-carboxamide ([11C]DFMC) was developed as an irreversible-type positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for FAAH. Here, we attempted to noninvasively estimate rate constant k3 (rate of transfer to the specifically-bound compartment) as a direct index for FAAH in the rat brain. First, the two-tissue compartment model analysis including three parameters [K1-k3, two-tissue compartment model for the irreversible-type radiotracer (2TCMi)] in PET study with [11C]DFMC was conducted, which provided 0.21 ± 0.04 ml·cm-3·min-1 of the net uptake value (Ki), an indirect index for FAAH, in the FAAH-richest region (the cingulate cortex). Subsequently, to noninvasively estimate Ki value, the reference model analysis (Patlak graphical analysis reference model) was tried using a time-activity curve of the spinal cord. In that result, the noninvasive Ki value (KREF) was concisely estimated with high correlation (r > 0.95) to Ki values based on 2TCMi. Using estimated KREF value, we tried to obtain calculated-k3 based on previously defined equations. The calculated k3 was successfully estimated with high correlation (r = 0.95) to direct k3 in 2TCMi. Finally, the dose relationship study using calculated k3 demonstrated that in vivo ED50 value of [3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl] N-cyclohexylcarbamate, a major inhibitor of FAAH, was 66.4 µg/kg in rat brain. In conclusion, we proposed the calculated k3 as an alternative index corresponding to regional FAAH concentrations and suggested that PET with [11C]DFMC enables occupancy study for new pharmaceuticals targeting FAAH. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the present study, we proposed calculated k3 as an alternative index corresponding with fatty acid amide hydrolase concentration. By using calculated k3, in vivo ED50 of [3-(3-carbamoylphenyl)phenyl] N-cyclohexylcarbamate was successfully estimated to be 66.4 µg/kg for rats.

8815,"TSPO PET, tumour grading and molecular genetics in histologically verified glioma: a correlative 18F-GE-180 PET study.","BACKGROUND
The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is overexpressed in brain tumours and represents an interesting target for glioma imaging. 18F-GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, has shown improved binding affinity and a high target-to-background contrast in patients with glioblastoma. However, the association of uptake characteristics on TSPO PET using 18F-GE-180 with the histological WHO grade and molecular genetic features so far remains unknown and was evaluated in the current study.


METHODS
Fifty-eight patients with histologically validated glioma at initial diagnosis or recurrence were included. All patients underwent 18F-GE-180 PET, and the maximal and mean tumour-to-background ratios (TBRmax, TBRmean) as well as the PET volume were assessed. On MRI, presence/absence of contrast enhancement was evaluated. Imaging characteristics were correlated with neuropathological parameters (i.e. WHO grade, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation, O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutation).


RESULTS
Six of 58 patients presented with WHO grade II, 16/58 grade III and 36/58 grade IV gliomas. An (IDH) mutation was found in 19/58 cases, and 39/58 were classified as IDH-wild type. High 18F-GE-180-uptake was observed in all but 4 cases (being WHO grade II glioma, IDH-mutant). A high association of 18F-GE-180-uptake and WHO grades was seen: WHO grade IV gliomas showed the highest uptake intensity compared with grades III and II gliomas (median TBRmax 5.15 (2.59-8.95) vs. 3.63 (1.85-7.64) vs. 1.63 (1.50-3.43), p < 0.001); this association with WHO grades persisted within the IDH-wild-type and IDH-mutant subgroup analyses (p < 0.05). Uptake intensity was also associated with the IDH mutational status with a trend towards higher 18F-GE-180-uptake in IDH-wild-type gliomas in the overall group (median TBRmax 4.67 (1.56-8.95) vs. 3.60 (1.50-7.64), p = 0.083); however, within each WHO grade, no differences were found (e.g. median TBRmax in WHO grade III glioma 4.05 (1.85-5.39) vs. 3.36 (2.32-7.64), p = 1.000). No association was found between uptake intensity and MGMT or TERT (p > 0.05 each).


CONCLUSION
Uptake characteristics on 18F-GE-180 PET are highly associated with the histological WHO grades, with the highest 18F-GE-180 uptake in WHO grade IV glioblastomas and a PET-positive rate of 100% among the investigated high-grade gliomas. Conversely, all TSPO-negative cases were WHO grade II gliomas. The observed association of 18F-GE-180 uptake and the IDH mutational status seems to be related to the high inter-correlation of the IDH mutational status and the WHO grades.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31486876,18F-GE-180,"18F-GE-180-uptake in IDH-wild-type gliomas",TERT,NULL,NULL
64884,"Comparison of 68Ga-FAPI and 18F-FDG Uptake in Gastric, Duodenal, and Colorectal Cancers.","Background Accurate clinical staging is crucial to managing gastrointestinal cancer, but fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT has limitations. Targeting fibroblast-activation protein is a newer diagnostic approach for the visualization of tumor stroma, and gallium 68 (68Ga)-labeled fibroblast-activation protein inhibitors (FAPIs), hereafter 68Ga-FAPIs, present a promising alternative to 18F-FDG. Purpose To compare the diagnostic efficacy of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT in primary and metastatic lesions of gastrointestinal malignancies with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT. Materials and Methods Images from patients with gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers who underwent contemporaneous 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT between October 2019 through June 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. 18F-FDG and 68Ga-FAPI uptakes were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The McNemar test was used to compare the diagnostic performance between the two techniques. Results Thirty-five patients (median age, 64 years [interquartile range, 53-68 years]; 18 men) were evaluated. In treatment-naive patients (n = 19), 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT led to upstaging of the clinical TNM stage in four (21%) patients compared with 18F-FDG PET/CT. Tracer uptake was higher with 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT than with 18F-FDG PET/CT in primary lesions (gastric cancer: 12.7 vs 3.7, respectively, P = .003; colorectal cancer: 15.9 vs 7.9, P = .03), involved lymph nodes (6.7 vs 2.4, P < .001), and bone and visceral metastases (liver metastases: 9.7 vs 5.2, P < .001; peritoneal metastases: 8.4 vs 3.6, P < .001; bone metastases: 4.3 vs 2.2, P < .001; lung metastases: 4.4 vs 1.9, P = .01). In addition, the sensitivity of 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT was higher than that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of primary tumors (100% [19 of 19] vs 53% [10 of 19], respectively; P = .004), lymph nodes (79% [22 of 28] vs 54% [15 of 28], P < .001), and bone and visceral metastases (89% [31 of 35] vs 57% [20 of 35], P < .001). Conclusion Gallium 68 fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor PET/CT was superior to fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT in the detection of primary and metastatic lesions in gastric, duodenal, and colorectal cancers, with higher tracer uptake in most primary and metastatic lesions.

Six patients (mild late-onset and moderate early-onset AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment due to AD, intermediate likelihood, mild behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia, subjective memory impairment without evidence of neurodegeneration, and mild dementia due to Posterior Cortical Atrophy) underwent PET imaging with 18F-FIBT on PET/MR. With the guidance of MRI, PET images were corrected for partial volume effect, time-activity curves (TACs) of regions of interest (ROIs) were extracted, and non-displaceable binding potentials (BPnd), standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR), and distribution volume ratio (DVR) were compared. Specific binding was detected in the cases with evidence of the AD pathophysiological process visualized in images of BPnd, DVR and SUVR, consistently with patterns of different tracers in previous studies. SUVR showed the highest correlation with clinical severity. The previous preclinical characterization and the results of this case series suggest the clinical usefulness of FIBT as a selective and highly affine next-generation 18F-labeled tracer for amyloid-imaging with excellent pharmacokinetics in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases.

Our objective was to investigate the relationship between the levels of NEDD-9, CA 15-3, and CEA and PET (SUVmax, MTV40, TLG40) with the clinical parameters of patients with breast cancer (BC). METHODS One hundred and eleven patients (82 BC patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT and 29 healthy controls) were evaluated. SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of the primary tumor were compared with the molecular and histopathological subtypes. 18F-FDG, MTV, and TLG were evaluated based on the clinical data, i.e., nodal involvement, distant metastasis, ER and PR status, Ki-67, serum levels of NEDD-9, CA15-3, and CEA. We compared the NEDD-9 in the BC and healthy control groups. RESULTS The mean ± SD of SUVmax in the 82 patients was 13.0 ± 8.6. A statistically significant relationship (p = 0.022) was found between the molecular subtypes and 18F-FDG uptake. The relationship between 18F-FDG uptake and TLG measured in patients <50 years, ER-PR negativity, and HER2 positivity were statistically significant (p=0.015, 0.007, 0.046, and 0.001, respectively). MTV40, TLG40, and CA 15-3 in metastatic patients were statistically significant (p=0.004, 0.005, and 0.003, respectively). NEDD-9 in the BC group was significantly higher than in the healthy group (p=0.017). There was a positive correlation between SUVmax and Ki67 and CA 15-3; MTV40 and CEA; CA 15-3, CEA, SUVmax, and MTV40; a negative correlation was found between CEA, TLG40, and age. CONCLUSION The use of SUVmax, MTV40, and TLG40 parameters with NEDD-9 and tumor markers has been shown to provide a high diagnostic, predictive, and prognostic value for the management of BC.

In this study we used 68Ga, a commercially available short-lived positron emitter, to label CAR T cells for noninvasive cell tracking in vivo. CAR T cells could be tracked in vivo by 68Ga-PET imaging for at least 6 h. We showed a significant correlation between the distribution of 89Zr and 68Ga-labeled CAR T cells in the same tissues (lungs, liver, and spleen). The distribution and homing behavior of CAR T cells at the early period is highly correlated with the long-term fate of CAR T cells in vivo. And the effective absorbed dose of 68Ga-labeled CAR T cells is only one twenty-fourth of 89Zr-labeled CAR T cells, which was safe for clinical translation. We conclude the feasibility of 68Ga instead of 89Zr directly labeling CAR T cells for noninvasive tracking of the cells in vivo at an early stage based on PET imaging. This method provides a potential solution to the emerging need for safe and practical PET tracer for cell tracking clinically.","Acta pharmacologica Sinica",32901086,68Ga,"89Zr-labeled CAR T cells","chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells",NULL,NULL

To investigate the potential value of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT in predicting the survival of patients with primary tracheal malignant tumors.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
An analysis of FDG PET/CT findings in 37 primary tracheal malignant tumor patients with a median follow-up period of 43.2 months (range, 10.8-143.2 months) was performed. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to assess the associations between quantitative 18F-FDG PET/CT parameters, other clinic-pathological factors, and overall survival (OS). A risk prognosis model was established according to the independent prognostic factors identified on multivariate analysis. A survival curve determined by the Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess whether the prognosis prediction model could effectively stratify patients with different risks factors.


RESULTS
The median survival time of the 37 patients with tracheal tumors was 38.0 months, with a 95% confidence interval of 10.8 to 65.2 months. The 3-year, 5-year and 10-year survival rate were 54.1%, 43.2%, and 16.2%, respectively. The metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), maximum standardized uptake value, age, pathological type, extension categories, and lymph node stage were included in multivariate analyses. Multivariate analysis showed MTV (p = 0.011), TLG (p = 0.020), pathological type (p = 0.037), and extension categories (p = 0.038) were independent prognostic factors for OS. Additionally, assessment of the survival curve using the Kaplan-Meier method showed that our prognosis prediction model can effectively stratify patients with different risks factors (p < 0.001).


CONCLUSION
This study shows that 18F-FDG PET/CT can predict the survival of patients with primary tracheal malignant tumors. Patients with an MTV > 5.19, a TLG > 16.94 on PET/CT scans, squamous cell carcinoma, and non-E1 were more likely to have a reduced OS.","Korean journal of radiology",33236543,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,"FDG PET/CT",NULL

A meta-analysis was performed to compare the diagnostic performance of gallium-68 (18Ga) somatostatin receptor positron emission tomography (68Ga-SSTR PET) and fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET in patients with neuroendocrine tumours (NET) and whether the two imaging modalities can be mutually substituted in clinical work.


METHODS
We performed electronic literature searches of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases for English-language articles from the earliest available date of indexing through 30 July 2019. We calculated the pooled sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of 68Ga-SSTR PET and 18F-FDG PET in NET. We drew a summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve and calculated the area under the curve (AUC) to measure the accuracy of 68Ga-SSTR PET and 18F-FDG PET in patients or lesions with NET.


RESULTS
Thirty studies comprising 3401 patients and 5793 lesions with NET were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, sensitivity, DOR and AUC for 68Ga-SSTR PET or PET/computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of NET, based on lesion patient, were 0.92(0.89-0.95), 0.91(0.83-0.95),119(51-282) and 0.96(0.94-0.98), and based on lesion, were 0.95(0.86-0.98), 0.93(0.83-0.97), 229(43-1205) and 0.98(0.96-0.99), respectively. The pooled sensitivity, sensitivity, DOR and AUC for 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT in NET were 0.70(0.41-0.89), 0.97(0.70-1.00), 67(7-612) and 0.94(0.92-0.96), respectively, when analyzed on a per-patient basis.The pooled sensitivities of 68Ga-SSTR PET/CT were 0.923 (95% CI: 0.884-0.952), 0.902 (0.862-0.934) and 0.578 (0.482-0.669) in the G1(ki67,≤2%), G2(ki67,>3%,≤20% and G3(ki67,>20%) groups based on patients with NET, respectively. The pooled sensitivities of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 0.378 (0.319-0.440), 0.554 (0.492-0.615) and 0.712 (0.633-0.783) in the G1, G2 and G3 groups based on patients with NET, respectively.


CONCLUSION
The 68Ga-SSTR PET has highly sensitive and had a greater diagnostic value than 18F-FDG PET for patients with NET. Fluorine-18-FDG PET, however, had significant specificity than 68Ga-SSTR PET.

20201,"Evaluation of Glycolytic Response to Multiple Classes of Anti-glioblastoma Drugs by Noninvasive Measurement of Pyruvate Kinase M2 Using [18F]DASA-23.","PURPOSE
Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) catalyzes the final step in glycolysis, the key process of tumor metabolism. PKM2 is found in high levels in glioblastoma (GBM) cells with marginal expression within healthy brain tissue, rendering it a key biomarker of GBM metabolic re-programming. Our group has reported the development of a novel radiotracer, 1-((2-fluoro- 6-[18F]fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-((4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)piperazine ([18F]DASA- 23), to non-invasively detect PKM2 levels with positron emission tomography (PET).


PROCEDURE
U87 human GBM cells were treated with the IC50 concentration of various agents used in the treatment of GBM, including alkylating agents (temozolomide, carmustine, lomustine, procarbazine), inhibitor of topoisomerase I (irinotecan), vascular endothelial and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cediranib and erlotinib, respectively) anti-metabolite (5-fluorouracil), microtubule inhibitor (vincristine), and metabolic agents (dichloroacetate and IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib). Following drug exposure for three or 6 days (n = 6 replicates per condition), the radiotracer uptake of [18F]DASA-23 and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) was assessed. Changes in PKM2 protein levels were determined via Western blot and correlated to radiotracer uptake.


RESULTS
Significant interactions were found between the treatment agent (n = 12 conditions total comprised 11 drugs and vehicle) and the duration of treatment (3- or 6-day exposure to each drug) on the cellular uptake of [18F]DASA-23 (p = 0.0001). The greatest change in the cellular uptake of [18F]DASA-23 was found after exposure to alkylating agents (p < 0. 0001) followed by irinotecan (p = 0. 0012), erlotinib (p = 0. 02), and 5-fluorouracil (p = 0. 005). Correlation of PKM2 protein levels and [18F]DASA-23 cellular uptake revealed a moderate correlation (r = 0.44, p = 0.15).


CONCLUSIONS
These proof of principle studies emphasize the superiority of [18F]DASA-23 to [18F]FDG in detecting the glycolytic response of GBM to multiple classes of anti-neoplastic drugs in cell culture.

27389,"18F-FDG PET/CT in lung adenosquamous carcinoma and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis.","OBJECTIVE
Lung adenosquamous carcinoma (ASC) is a rare histological subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to its rarity, the studies about 18F-FDG PET/CT in this kind of pulmonary tumor were quite limited. Thus, this study investigated 18F-FDG PET/CT findings in ASC and its correlation with clinicopathological features and clinical outcomes.


METHODS
Preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT findings and parameters of maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis of primary lesion (MTV-P, TLG-P), combination of primary lesion and metastases (MTV-C, TLG-C), and clinicopathological features were retrospectively investigated in patients with ASC. Moreover, progression-free survival (PFS) was also analyzed.


RESULTS
All 41 patients (25 men; 16 women; age: 60 ± 7 years) had single ASC with the mean diameter of 33 ± 14 mm. Six lesions were located centrally and 35 peripherally. Serum tumor markers were abnormally increased sporadically. Twenty-two cases were at TNM stage I, 9 at II, and 10 at III. The primary tumors were FDG-avid in all cases, with the average SUVmax of 11.5 ± 6.0. SUVmax was significantly associated with tumor location, size, and TNM stage (P < 0.05). Forty-one lesions were subgrouped into 23 AC-predominant and 18 SCC-predominant lesions, and significant differences were observed for age, tumor size, and SUVmax in two groups (P < 0.05). The median PFS of 41 cases was 19 months, and 12-month and 24-month PFS rates were 72.1% and 36.1%, respectively. SUVmax, MTV-P, and TLG-C were significantly associated with PFS (P < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
ASC of the lung displayed high SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET/CT, which was associated with tumor location, size, TNM stage, and predominant histologic component. Moreover, metabolic parameters of 18F-FDG PET/CT were independent prognostic factors of this rare lung malignancy.","Annals of nuclear medicine",32088884,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",ASC,NULL,NULL

49327,"Improved detection of diffuse glioma infiltration with imaging combinations: a diagnostic accuracy study.","BACKGROUND
Surgical resection and irradiation of diffuse glioma are guided by standard MRI: T2/fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)-weighted MRI for non-enhancing and T1-weighted gadolinium-enhanced (T1G) MRI for enhancing gliomas. Amino acid PET has been suggested as the new standard. Imaging combinations may improve standard MRI and amino acid PET. The aim of the study was to determine the accuracy of imaging combinations to detect glioma infiltration.


METHODS
We included 20 consecutive adults with newly diagnosed non-enhancing glioma (7 diffuse astrocytomas, isocitrate dehydrogenase [IDH] mutant; 1 oligodendroglioma, IDH mutant and 1p/19q codeleted; 1 glioblastoma IDH wildtype) or enhancing glioma (glioblastoma, 9 IDH wildtype and 2 IDH mutant). Standardized preoperative imaging (T1-, T2-, FLAIR-weighted, and T1G MRI, perfusion and diffusion MRI, MR spectroscopy and O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine ([18F]FET) PET) was co-localized with multiregion stereotactic biopsies preceding resection. Tumor presence in the biopsies was assessed by 2 neuropathologists. Diagnostic accuracy was determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis.


RESULTS
A total of 174 biopsies were obtained (63 from 9 non-enhancing and 111 from 11 enhancing gliomas), of which 129 contained tumor (50 from non-enhancing and 79 from enhancing gliomas). In enhancing gliomas, the combination of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with [18F]FET PET (area under the curve [AUC], 95% CI: 0.89, 0.79‒0.99) detected tumor better than T1G MRI (0.56, 0.39‒0.72; P < 0.001) and [18F]FET PET (0.76, 0.66‒0.86; P = 0.001). In non-enhancing gliomas, no imaging combination detected tumor significantly better than standard MRI. FLAIR-weighted MRI had an AUC of 0.81 (0.65-0.98) compared with 0.69 (0.56-0.81; P = 0.019) for [18F]FET PET.

Neuropeptide Y (NPY) has been implicated in a wide variety of physiological processes, including feeding, learning, memory, emotion, cardiovascular homeostasis, hormone secretion, and circadian rhythms. NPY Yl receptor (NPY Y1-R) is the most widely studied NPY receptor, and is involved in many of these processes. BMS-193885 (1) was previously developed as a potent and selective NPY Y1-R antagonist, which has good systemic bioavailability and brain penetration. To evaluate the characteristics of 1 in vivo, we developed 11C-labeled BMS-193885 ([11C]1) and its desmethyl analog ([11C]2) for potential use as two new positron emission tomography (PET) tracers.


RESULTS
[11C]1 was synthesized from [11C]methyl iodide using 2. [11C]2 was synthesized from [11C]phosgene using its aniline and amine derivatives. The mean ± S.D. decay-corrected radiochemical yields of [11C]1 and [11C]2 from 11CO2 at the end of radionuclide production were 23 ± 3.2% (n = 6) and 24 ± 1.5% (n = 4), respectively. In biodistribution on mice, radioactivity levels for both tracers were relatively high in the kidney, small intestine, and liver at 60 min post-injection. The radioactivity levels in the kidney, lung, and spleen of mice at 30 min post-injection with [11C]1 were significantly reduced by pretreatment with 1 (10 mg/kg), and levels of [11C]1 in the brain of mice were significantly increased by pretreatment with the P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein inhibitor elacridar (10 mg/kg). In metabolite analysis using mouse plasma, [11C]1 and [11C]2 were rapidly metabolized within 30 min post-injection, and [11C]1 was mainly metabolized into unlabeled 2 and radiolabeled components.


CONCLUSION
[11C]1 and [11C]2 were successfully synthesized with sufficient amount of radioactivity and high quality for use in vivo.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and PET/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging with 3,4-dihydroxy-6-[18F] fluoro-L-phenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) has been used in the evaluation of gliomas. We performed a meta-analysis to obtain the diagnostic and grading accuracy of 18F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT in patients with gliomas.


METHODS
PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched through 13 May 2019. We included studies reporting the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDOPA PET or PET/CT in glioma patients. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were calculated from eligible studies on a per-lesion basis.


RESULTS
Eventually, 19 studies were included. Across 13 studies (370 patients) for glioma diagnosis, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of 18F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT were 0.90 (95%CI: 0.86-0.93) and 0.75 (95%CI: 0.65-0.83). Across 7 studies (219 patients) for glioma grading, 18F-FDOPA PET and PET/CT showed a pooled sensitivity of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.81-0.93) and a pooled specificity of 0.73 (95%CI: 0.64-0.81).

Methods: OF-NB1 and MF-NB1 were prepared using a multi-step synthesis and their binding affinities towards GluN2B subunits and selectivity over sigma-1 receptors (σ1Rs) were determined via competitive binding assays. 18F-OF-NB1 was synthesized via copper-mediated radiofluorination, and was evaluated in Wistar rats by in vitro autoradiography, PET imaging, ex vivo biodistribution, metabolite experiments and receptor occupancy studies using CP-101,606, an established GluN2B antagonist. To determine in vivo selectivity, 18F-OF-NB1 was validated in wild-type and σ1R knock-out mice. Translational relevance was assessed in autoradiographic studies using postmortem human brain tissues from healthy individuals and ALS patients, the results of which were corroborated by immunohistochemistry. Results: The binding affinity values for OF-NB1 and MF-NB1 towards the GluN2B subunits were 10.4 ± 4.7 nM and 590 ± 36 nM, respectively. For σ1R binding, OF-NB1 and MF-NB1 exhibited Ki values of 410 nM and 2700 nM, respectively. OF-NB1, which outperformed MF-NB1, was radiolabeled with 18F to afford 18F-OF-NB1 in > 95% radiochemical purity and molar activities of 192±33 GBq/μmol. In autoradiography experiments, 18F-OF-NB1 displayed a heterogeneous and specific binding in GluN2B subunit-rich brain regions such as the cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and hippocampus. PET imaging studies in Wistar rats showed a similar heterogeneous uptake, and no brain radiometabolites were detected. A dose-dependent blocking effect was observed with CP-101,606 (0.5-15 mg/kg) and resulted in a D50 of 8.1 µmol/kg. Postmortem autoradiography results revealed a lower expression level of the GluN2B subunits in ALS brain tissue sections compared to healthy controls, in line with immunohistochemistry results. Conclusion: 18F-OF-NB1 is a highly promising PET imaging probe for imaging the GluN2B subunits of the NMDAR.

[18F]MK-6240 is a selective, high-affinity positron emission tomography tracer for imaging neurofibrillary tangles, a key pathological signature that correlates with cognitive decline in Alzheimer disease. This report provides safety information from preclinical toxicology studies and first-in-human whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry studies of [18F]MK-6240 for its potential application in human brain imaging studies.


PROCEDURES
MK-6240 was administered intravenously (IV) in a 7-day rat toxicity study at × 50, × 100, and × 1000 dose margins relative to projected highest clinical dose of 0.333 μg/kg. The IV formulation of MK-6240 for clinical use and the formulation used in the 7-day rat toxicity study was tested for hemolysis potential in human and Wistar rat whole blood. Sequential whole-body positron emission tomography scans were performed in three healthy young subjects after IV bolus injection of 180 ± 0.3 MBq [18F]MK-6240 to characterize organ biodistribution and estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose).


RESULTS
MK-6240 administered IV in a 7-day rat toxicity study did not show any test article-related changes. The no-observed-adverse-effect level in rats was ≥ 333 μg/kg/day which provides a margin 1000-fold over an anticipated maximum clinical dose of 0.333 μg/kg. Additionally, the MK-6240 formulation was not hemolytic in human or Wistar rat blood. [18F]MK-6240 activity was widely distributed to the brain and the rest of the body, with organ absorbed doses largest for the gall bladder (202 μGy/MBq). The average (±SD) effective dose was 29.4 ± 0.6 μSv/MBq, which is in the typical range for F-18 radiolabeled ligands.


CONCLUSIONS
Microdoses of [18F]MK-6240 are safe for clinical positron emission tomography imaging studies. Single IV administration of 185 MBq (5 mCi) [18F]MK-6240 is anticipated to result in a total human effective dose of 5.4 mSv and thus allows multiple positron emission tomography scans of the same subject per year.","Molecular imaging and biology",31111397,[18F]MK-6240,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The two available positions on the [Al(NTA)] complex feature significantly different properties in terms of basicity of the coordinated water molecules and preferential binding of fluoride anions. Fluorides are effectively bound in weakly acidic or neutral solutions, whereas hydroxido species are preferentially formed in alkaline solutions. Our experimental observations were rationalized by theoretical calculations: predictions of the energy ordering of complexes and isomers, interpretation of 19F NMR chemical shifts, and natural bonding orbital analysis.

Imaging the metabolic pathways of L-glutamine could provide more insights into tumor biology. Reliable and reproducible automated synthesis of [11C]L-glutamine PET (Positron Emission Tomography) radiotracer is critical for these studies.


RESULTS
[11C]L-Glutamine ([11C]L-Gln) was reliably and reproducibly synthesized. The automated process involves cleaning and drying of the synthesis module, azeotropic drying of crown ether and cesium bicarbonate, conversion of [11C]CO2 to [11C] CsCN, incorporation of [11C] CN into the starting material, and hydrolysis and deprotection of the corresponding [11C] nitrile to yield [11C]L-glutamine. Starting with approximately 1 Ci of [11C] cesium cyanide ([11C]CsCN), 47-77 mCi (n = 4) of the final product, [11C]L-Gln, was obtained after sterile filtration.

Previous studies have shown that increased cardiac uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) may be an indicator of myocardial injury after radiotherapy (RT). The primary objective of this study was to quantify cardiac subvolume dosimetry and 18F-FDG uptake on oncologic PET using a 17-segment model of the left ventricle (LV) and to identify dose limits related to changes in cardiac 18F-FDG uptake after RT.


Methods
Twenty-four esophageal cancer (EC) patients who underwent consecutive oncologic 18F-FDG PET/CT scans at baseline and post-RT were enrolled in this study. The radiation dose and the 18F-FDG uptake were quantitatively analyzed based on a 17-segment model. The 18F-FDG uptake and doses to the basal, middle and apical regions, and the changes in the 18F-FDG uptake for different dose ranges were analyzed.


Results
A heterogeneous dose distribution was observed, and the basal region received a higher median mean dose (18.36 Gy) than the middle and apical regions (5.30 and 2.21 Gy, respectively). Segments 1, 2, 3, and 4 received the highest doses, all of which were greater than 10 Gy. Three patterns were observed for the myocardial 18F-FDG uptake in relation to the radiation dose before and after RT: an increase (5 patients), a decrease (13 patients), and no change (6 patients).

This study aimed to investigate the optimal conditions for producing 68Ga-labeled tin colloid and the feasibility of 68Ga-tin colloid positron emission tomography (PET) for visualization and evaluation of the phagocytic function of Kupffer cells (KCs) in vivo.


METHODS
68Ga-tin colloid was prepared by adding tin solution (1 mM, 0.2 mL) to 68Ga solution (1.0 mL), followed by pH adjustment with sodium acetate (1 M, 0.2 mL). Various labeling times were tested to find the optimal one. Colloid size was measured by filtering the solution through three-ply membrane filters (with pore sizes of 200, 3000, and 5000 nm), and radioactivity was measured in the whole filtrate and the filters using a gamma counter. The in vitro stability of the colloid was evaluated by the size measurement after incubation under ambient conditions for up to 60 min. PET scanning was performed for 30 min after intravenous administration of 68Ga-tin colloid solution (4 MBq) to healthy rats. Time-activity-curves for the liver, spleen, and blood pool were generated. Finally, liver uptake was compared before and after the establishment of KC-depletion and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) rat models.


RESULTS
Colloid size increased with increasing labeling time. After pH adjustment, the colloid sizes remained nearly unchanged. The optimal labeling time was determined as 30 min. PET imaging of healthy rats revealed that liver uptake of the 68Ga-tin colloid increased with increasing colloid size. In KC-depleted rats, liver uptake significantly decreased (n = 4, p < 0.01). NASH model rats showed significantly decreased uptake of 68Ga-tin colloid in the livers (n = 5, p < 0.01).


CONCLUSIONS
68Ga-tin colloid, prepared by a simple radiolabeling method, enabled in vivo PET imaging to evaluate the phagocytic function of KCs.","Annals of nuclear medicine",32749578,68Ga-tin,"68Ga-tin colloid",NULL,NULL,NULL

Recent studies have demonstrated that the expression level of PD-L1 in tumors is one of the factors that correlate with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade therapy. Herein, a 68Ga-labeled single-domain antibody tracer, 68Ga-NOTA-Nb109, was designed and developed for specific and noninvasive imaging of PD-L1 expression in a melanoma-bearing mouse model. Methods: The single-domain antibody Nb109 was labeled with the radionuclide 68Ga through a NOTA chelator. An in vitro binding assay was performed to assess the affinity and binding epitope of Nb109 to PD-L1. The clinical application value of 68Ga-NOTA-Nb109 was evaluated by a stability assay; by biodistribution and pharmacokinetics studies; and by PET imaging, autoradiography, and immunohistochemical staining studies on tumor-bearing models with differences in PD-L1 expression. Results: 68Ga-NOTA-Nb109 was obtained with a radiochemical yield of more than 95% and radiochemical purity of more than 98% in 10 min. It showed a highly specific affinity for PD-L1, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 2.9 × 10-9 M. A competitive binding assay indicated Nb109 to have a binding epitope different from that of PD-1 and PD-L1 antibody.

The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG-PET/CT) in patients with FUO. We retrospectively reviewed 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans performed on 50 consecutive adult patients referred to our department for further investigation of classic FUO. Final diagnosis was based on histopathological and microbiological findings, clinical criteria, or clinical follow-up. Final diagnosis was established in 39/50 (78%) of the patients. The cause of FUO was infection in 20/50 (40%), noninfectious inflammatory diseases in 11/50 (22%), and malignancy in 8/50 (16%) patients. Fever remained unexplained in 11/50 (22%) patients. 18F-FDG-PET/CT scan substantially contributed to the diagnosis in 70% of the patients, either by identifying the underlying cause of FUO or by directing to the most appropriate site for biopsy.

Diagnosis of spinal infection (SI) is challenging and usually requires multiple tests. We aimed to perform a systematic review and a bivariate meta-analysis on the diagnostic role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with SI.


METHODS
A comprehensive literature search of studies published through February 2019 in PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane library databases was carried out. Studies investigating the diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with SI were eligible for inclusion in the qualitative analysis. For the quantitative analysis, pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR+ and LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected SI were calculated on a per examination-based analysis. Pooled data were presented with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).


RESULTS
Twenty-six articles (833 patients) using 18F-FDG PET/CT were eligible for the qualitative analysis. Twelve studies (396 patients) were selected for the meta-analysis. Overall, 18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated a very good diagnostic performance in patients with SI and several studies underlined the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the response to treatment. The bivariate meta-analysis on 18F-FDG PET/CT in patients with suspected SI provided the following results: sensitivity 94.8% (95% CI 88.9-97.6%) and specificity 91.4% (95% CI 78.2-96.9%).

CONCLUSION
18F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated a very good diagnostic performance in patients with SI and can be used in patients in which MRI cannot be performed or is non-diagnostic or inconclusive. Several studies underlined the value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the response to treatment in patients with SI.

25685,"Targeting VPAC1 Receptors for Imaging Glioblastoma.","PURPOSE
Scintigraphic imaging of malignant glioblastoma (MG) continues to be challenging. We hypothesized that VPAC1 cell surface receptors can be targeted for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of orthotopically implanted MG in a mouse model, using a VPAC1-specific peptide [64Cu]TP3805.


PROCEDURES
The expression of VPAC1 in mouse GL261 and human U87 glioma cell lines was determined by western blot. The ability of [64Cu]TP3805 to bind to GL261 and U87 cells was studied by cell-binding. Receptor-blocking studies were performed to validate receptor specificity. GL261 tumors were implanted orthotopically in syngeneic T-bet knockout C57BL/6 mouse brain (N = 15) and allowed to grow for 2-3 weeks. Mice were injected i.v., first with ~ 150 μCi of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) then 24 h later with ~ 200 μCi of [64Cu]TP3805. In another set of tumor-bearing mice, (N = 5), ionic [64Cu]Cl2 was injected as a control. Mice were imaged at a 2-h post-injection using an Inveon micro-PET/CT, sacrificed and % ID/g of [64Cu]TP3805 and [64Cu]Cl2 were calculated in a tumor, normal brain, and other tissues. For histologic tissue examination, 3-μm thick sections of the tumors and normal brain were prepared, digital autoradiography (DAR) was performed, and then the sections were H&E stained for histologic examination.


RESULTS
Western blots showed a strong signal for VPAC1 on both cell lines. [64Cu]TP3805 cell-binding was 87 ± 1.5 %. Receptor-blocking reduced cell-binding to 24.3 ± 1.5 % (P < 0.01). PET imaging revealed remarkable accumulation of [64Cu]TP3805 in GL261 MG with a negligible background in the normal brain, as compared to [18F]FDG. Micro-PET/CT image analyses and tissue distribution showed that the brain tumor uptake for [64Cu]TP3805 was 8.2 ± 1.7 % ID/g and for [64Cu]Cl2 2.1 ± 0.5 % ID/g as compared to 1.0 ± 0.3 % ID/g and 1.4 ± 0.3 % ID/g for normal mouse brains, respectively. The high tumor/normal brain ratio for [64Cu]TP3805 (8.1 ± 1.1) allowed tumors to be visualized unequivocally. Histology and [64Cu]TP3805 DAR differentiated malignant tumors from healthy brain and confirmed PET findings.

Targeting VPAC1 receptors using [64Cu]TP3805 for PET imaging of MG is a promising novel approach and calls for further investigation.","Molecular imaging and biology",31292914,[64Cu]TP3805,"[64Cu]TP3805 DAR","VPAC1 receptors",NULL,"GL261 MG"
33525,"Characterization of glucose uptake metabolism in visceral fat by 18 F-FDG PET/CT reflects inflammatory status in metabolic syndrome.","OBJECTIVE
The inflammatory activity of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is elevated in metabolic syndrome (MS), and associated with vulnerability to atherosclerosis. Inflammation can be assessed by glucose uptake in atherosclerotic plaques. We investigated whether the glucose uptake of VAT, assessed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), is associated with systemic inflammatory status, and related to the number of MS components.


METHODS
18F-FDG PET/CT was performed in a total of 203 participants: 59 without MS component; M(0), 92 with one or two MS components; M(1-2), and 52 with MS. Glucose uptake in VAT was evaluated using the mean standardized uptake value (SUVmean) and the maximum SUV (SUVmax). Glucose uptakes of immune-related organs such as the spleen and bone marrow (BM) were evaluated using the SUVmax.


RESULTS
VAT SUVmax correlated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and the SUVmax of spleen and BM, which reflect the status of systemic inflammation. Both hsCRP and the SUVmax of the spleen and BM were higher in the MS group than in the M(1-2) or M(0) groups. In VAT, SUVmax increased with increasing number of MS components, while SUVmean decreased.


CONCLUSIONS
The SUVmax and SUVmean of VAT assessed by 18F-FDG PET/CT reflected inflammation-driven unique glucose metabolism in the VAT of MS patients, distinct from that of atherosclerotic plaques.","PloS one",32027706,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL

Biomarker accuracy for Alzheimer disease (AD) is uncertain.


PURPOSE
To summarize evidence on biomarker accuracy for classifying AD in older adults with dementia.


DATA SOURCES
Electronic bibliographic databases (searched from January 2012 to November 2019 for brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] tests and from inception to November 2019 for blood tests), ClinicalTrials.gov (to November 2019), and systematic review bibliographies.


STUDY SELECTION
English-language studies evaluating the accuracy of brain imaging, CSF testing, or blood tests for distinguishing neuropathologically defined AD from non-AD among older adults with dementia. Studies with low or medium risk of bias were analyzed.


DATA EXTRACTION
Two reviewers rated risk of bias. One extracted data; the other verified accuracy.


DATA SYNTHESIS
Fifteen brain imaging studies and 9 CSF studies met analysis criteria. Median sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 0.91 and 0.92 for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), 0.89 and 0.74 for 18F-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, 0.64 and 0.83 for single-photon emission computed tomography, and 0.91 and 0.89 for medial temporal lobe atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individual CSF biomarkers and ratios had moderate sensitivity (range, 0.62 to 0.83) and specificity (range, 0.53 to 0.69); in the few direct comparisons, β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42)/phosphorylated tau (p-tau) ratio, total tau (t-tau)/Aβ42 ratio, and p-tau appeared more accurate than Aβ42 and t-tau alone. Single studies suggested that amyloid PET, 18F-FDG PET, and CSF test combinations may add accuracy to clinical evaluation.


LIMITATIONS
Studies were small, biomarker cut points and neuropathologic AD were inconsistently defined, and methods with uncertain applicability to typical clinical settings were used. Few studies directly compared biomarkers, assessed test combinations, evaluated whether biomarkers improved classification accuracy when added to clinical evaluation, or reported harms.


CONCLUSION
In methodologically heterogeneous studies of uncertain applicability to typical clinical settings, amyloid PET, 18F-FDG PET, and MRI were highly sensitive for neuropathologic AD. Amyloid PET, 18F-FDG PET, and CSF test combinations may add accuracy to clinical evaluation.

Peptide-based imaging agents targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have revolutionized the evaluation of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer (PCa) but lacks sensitivity at very low serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels. Once recurrence is suspected, other positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers could be of interest to discriminate between local and distant relapse. We studied [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) targeting glucose metabolism, [18F]fluorocholine ([18F]FCH) targeting membrane metabolism and peptide-based imaging agents [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11, [68Ga]Ga-AMBA, [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 targeting PSMA, gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr), αvβ3 integrin and neurotensin type 1 receptor (NTSR1) respectively, in different PCa tumour models.


METHODS
Mice were xenografted with 22Rv1, an androgen-receptor (AR)-positive, PCa cell line that expresses PSMA and PC3, an AR-negative one that does not express PSMA. PET imaging using the different radiotracers was performed sequentially and the uptake characteristics compared to one other. NTSR1 and PSMA expression levels were analysed in tumours by immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
[18F]FDG displayed low but sufficient uptake to visualize PC3 and 22Rv1 derived tumours. We also observed a low efficacy of [18F]FCH PET imaging and a low [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-RGD tumour uptake in those tumours. As expected, an elevated tumour uptake was obtained for [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 in 22Rv1 derived tumour although no uptake was measured in the androgen independent cell line PC3, derived from a bone metastasis of a high-grade PCa. Moreover, in PC3 cell line, we obtained good tumour uptake, high tumour-to-background contrast using [68Ga]Ga-AMBA and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed high NTSR1 expression in PC3 derived tumours and conversely high PSMA expression in 22Rv1 derived tumours.


CONCLUSION
PET imaging using [68Ga]Ga-AMBA and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 demonstrates that GRPr and NTSR1 could represent viable alternative targets for diagnostic or therapeutic applications in PCa with limited PSMA expression levels. More preclinical and clinical studies will follow to explore this potential.


ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT
Peptide-based imaging agents targeting PSMA represent a major progress in the evaluation of biochemical recurrence of PCa but sometimes yield false negative results in some lesions. Continuing efforts have thus been made to evaluate other radiotracers.

[11C]Deuterodeprenyl ([11C]DED) is a tracer that has been used for reactive astrocyte detection in Alzheimer's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, among others, with some limitations. To develop a new radiotracer for detecting astrocytosis and overcoming associated difficulties, we recently reported the synthesis of a sulfonamide derivative of Sulforhodamine 101 (SR101), labeled with 18F, namely SR101 N-(3-[18F]Fluoropropyl) sulfonamide ([18F]2B-SRF101). The red fluorescent dye SR101 has been used as a specific marker of astroglia in the neocortex of rodents using in vivo models. In the present work we performed a biological characterisation of the new tracer including biodistribution and micro-PET/computed tomography (CT) images. PET/CT studies with [11C]DED were also done to compare with [18F]2B-SRF101 in order to assess its potential as an astrocyte marker. Biodistribution studies with [18F]2B-SRF101 were carried out in C57BL6J black and transgenic (3xTg) mice.

Dynamic PET/CT studies were carried out with [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED to evaluate the distribution of both tracers in the brain. A significant difference in [18F]2B-SRF101 uptake was especially observed in the cortex and hippocampus, and it was higher in 3xTg mice than it was in the control group. These results suggested that [18F]2B-SRF101 is a promising candidate for more extensive evaluation as an astrocyte tracer. The difference observed for [18F]2B-SRF101 was not found in the case of [11C]DED. The comparative studies between [18F]2B-SRF101 and [11C]DED suggest that both tracers have different roles as astrocytosis markers in this animal model, and could provide different and complementary information at the same time.

Tc-99m- and I-131-labeled arginine-arginine-leucine (RRL) peptides have shown the feasibility of tumor imaging in our previous studies. However, there have been no reports using RRL peptide for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this study, RRL was radiolabeled with Ga-68 under optimized reaction conditions to develop a better specific and effective tumor imaging agent.


PROCEDURES
RRL was synthesized and conjugated to a bifunctional chelating agent (DOTA-NHS), then radiolabeled with Ga-68. Labeling yield was optimized by varying pH, temperature, and reaction time and the stability was evaluated in human fresh serum. Cellular uptakes of [68Ga]DOTA-RRL and FITC-conjugated RRL in HepG2 cells were evaluated using a gamma counter, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry. PET images and biodistribution were performed in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice after injection of [68Ga]DOTA-RRL or [68Ga]GaCl3 at different time points. Further, blocking study was investigated using cold RRL.


RESULTS
The labeling yield of [68Ga]DOTA-RRL was 80.6 ± 3.9 % with a pH of 3.5-4.5 at 100 °C for 15 min. The cellular uptake of [68Ga]DOTA-RRL in HepG2 cells was significantly higher than that of [68Ga]GaCl3 (P < 0.05). Moreover, the high fluorescent affinity of FITC-conjugated RRL in HepG2 cells was shown using confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. After injection of [68Ga]DOTA-RRL in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice, tumor regions exhibited high radioactive accumulation over 120 min and the highest uptake at 30 min. After blocked with cold RRL, HepG2 tumors could not be visualized. [68Ga]GaCl3 was unable to show tumor images at any time point. The biodistribution results confirmed the PET imaging and blocking results.

Eleven AD, 17 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 13 cognitively normal (CN) subjects underwent neuropsychological assessment and amyloid PET imaging using [18F]-FMM and [11C]-PIB during a follow-up period. Regions of interest were defined on co-registered MRI, and the FMM and PIB standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was used in the same cortical regions. The annual rate of change in FMM and PIB SUVRs was calculated. Cortical FMM SUVR in amyloid-positive subjects increased over a follow-up of 3.1 ± 0.5 years. An individual FMM SUVR was significantly correlated with PIB SUVR at baseline and at follow-up in the same AD, MCI, and CN subjects. The annual rate of increase in FMM SUVR was significantly greater in typical amyloid-positive (0.033 ± 0.023, n = 7), focal positive MCI (0.076 ± 0.034, n = 4) and positive CN (0.039 ± 0.027, n = 4) while that in AD (0.020 ± 0.018, n = 11) was smaller. Among amyloid-positive patients, the baseline FMM SUVR was inversely related with the increased rate in FMM SUVR (r=-0.44, n = 26, p < 0.05). An individual annual rate in change of cortical FMM SUVR was significantly correlated with that in cortical PIB SUVR. Our results suggest that the [18F]-FMM PET imaging can clarify the longitudinal assessment of Aβ deposition across the AD spectrum, similarly to [11C]-PIB PET. The Increase in Aβ deposition is faster in the predementia stage but not at a constant rate across the clinical stages of the AD spectrum.","Frontiers in aging neuroscience",31572167,"[11C]-PIB PET","[18F]-flutemetamol (FMM) PET","amyloid-β (Aβ)",NULL,NULL

Overexpression of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in human cancer is offering a powerful opportunity for tumor-selective imaging and treatment employing nuclear medicine. We utilized novel chemerin-based peptide conjugates for chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) targeting in a breast cancer xenograft model. Methods: By conjugation with the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), we obtained a family of five highly specific, high-affinity tracers for hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging. A xenograft model with target-positive DU4475 and negative A549 tumors in immunodeficient nude mice enabled CMKLR1-specific imaging in vivo. We acquired small animal PET/MR images, assessed biodistribution by ex vivo measurements and investigated the tracer specificity by blocking experiments. Results: Five CMKLR1-targeting peptide tracers demonstrated high biological activity and affinity in vitro with EC50 and IC50 values below 2 nM. Our target-positive (DU4475) and target-negative (A549) xenograft model could be validated by ex vivo analysis of CMKLR1 expression and binding. After preliminary PET imaging, the three most promising tracers [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-AHX-CG34, [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-KCap-CG34 and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-ADX-CG34 with best tumor uptake were further analyzed. Hybrid PET/MR imaging along with concomitant biodistribution studies revealed distinct CMKLR1-specific uptake (5.1% IA/g, 3.3% IA/g and 6.2% IA/g 1 h post-injection) of our targeted tracers in DU4475 tumor tissue. In addition, tumor uptake was blocked by excess of unlabeled peptide (6.4-fold, 5.5-fold and 3.4-fold 1 h post-injection), further confirming CMKLR1 specificity. Out of five tracers, we identified these three tracers with moderate, balanced hydrophilicity to be the most potent in receptor-mediated tumor targeting.

16832,"Promising clinical performance of pretargeted immuno-PET with anti-CEA bispecific antibody and gallium-68-labelled IMP-288 peptide for imaging colorectal cancer metastases: a pilot study.","INTRODUCTION
This pilot study evaluated the imaging performance of pretargeted immunological positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) using an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) recombinant bispecific monoclonal antibody (BsMAb), TF2 and the [68Ga]Ga-labelled HSG peptide, IMP288, in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (CRC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients requiring diagnostic workup of CRC metastases or in case of elevated CEA for surveillance were prospectively studied. They had to present with elevated CEA serum titre or positive CEA tumour staining by immunohistochemistry of a previous biopsy or surgical specimen. All patients underwent endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), chest-abdominal-pelvic computed tomography (CT), abdominal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET). For immuno-PET, patients received intravenously 120 nmol of TF2 followed 30 h later by 150 MBq of [68Ga]Ga-labelled IMP288, both I.V. The gold standard was histology and imaging after 6-month follow-up.


RESULTS
Eleven patients were included. No adverse effects were reported after BsMAb and peptide injections. In a per-patient analysis, immuno-PET was positive in 9/11 patients. On a per-lesion analysis, 12 of 14 lesions were positive with immuno-PET. Median SUVmax, MTV and TLG were 7.65 [3.98-13.94, SD 3.37], 8.63 cm3 [1.98-46.64; SD 14.83] and 37.90 cm3 [8.07-127.5; SD 43.47] respectively for immuno-PET lesions. Based on a per-lesion analysis, the sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value and negative-predictive value were, respectively, 82%, 25%, 82% and 25% for the combination of EUS/CT/MRI; 76%, 67%, 87% and 33% for FDG-PET; and 88%, 100%, 100% and 67% for immuno-PET. Immuno-PET had an impact on management in 2 patients.


CONCLUSION
This pilot study showed that pretargeted immuno-PET using anti-CEA/anti-IMP288 BsMAb and a [68Ga]Ga-labelled hapten was safe and feasible, with promising diagnostic performance.

18272,"Diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/MRI for staging in patients with endometrial cancer.","BACKGROUND
Preoperative accurate assessment of endometrial cancer can assist in the planning of additional surgical options, and in predicting the prognosis. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic potential of non-contrast PET/MRI with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) for assessment in preoperative staging of endometrial cancer.


METHODS
Thirty-six patients with biopsy-proven endometrial cancer underwent preoperative 18F-FDG PET/MRI, contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) and pelvic dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) for initial staging. The diagnostic performance of 18F-FDG PET/MRI and ceMRI for assessing the extent of the primary tumor (T stage), and 18F-FDG PET/MRI and ceCT for assessing nodal (N stage) and distant (M stage) metastasis, was evaluated by two experienced readers. Histopathological and follow-up imaging results were used as the gold standard. The McNemar test was employed for statistical analysis.


RESULTS
Accuracy for T status was 77.8 and 75.0% for 18F-FDG PET/MRI and ceMRI, respectively. Patient-based accuracy for detecting regional nodal and distant metastasis was 91.3 and 81.8% for 18F-FDG PET/MRI, and 87.0 and 81.8% for ceCT. None of these parameters was statistically significant (p > 0.05). Lesion-based sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for detecting regional nodal metastasis were 100, 96.9 and 97.0% for 18F-FDG PET/MRI, and 14.3, 97.6 and 93.3% for ceCT; sensitivity was statistically significant (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Non-contrast 18F-FDG PET/MRI, which combines the individual advantages of PET and MRI, offers a high diagnostic value equivalent to that of ceMRI for assessment of the primary tumor, and equivalent to that of ceCT for the assessment of nodal and distant metastatic staging, in patients with endometrial cancer. These findings suggest that 18F-FDG PET/MRI might provide an alternative diagnostic strategy to conventional imaging modalities in the preoperative staging of endometrial cancer.","Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society",33092631,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/MRI",NULL,NULL,NULL

A novel selective and reversible MAO-B tracer, (S)-(2-methylpyrid-5-yl)-6-[(3-[18F]fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy]quinoline, (18F-SMBT-1), was successfully developed via lead optimization from first-generation tau positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-THK-5351. Methods: SMBT-1 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 using the corresponding precursor. The binding affinity of radiolabeled compounds to MAO-B was assessed using saturation and competitive binding assays. The binding selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 to MAO-B was evaluated by autoradiography of frozen human brain tissues. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism were assessed in normal mice after intravenous administration of 18F-SMBT-1. A 14-day toxicity study following the intravenous administration of SMBT-1 was performed using rats and mice. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated a high binding affinity of SMBT-1 to MAO-B (KD = 3.7 nM). In contrast, it showed low binding affinity to MAO-A and protein aggregates such as amyloid-β and tau fibrils. Autoradiographic analysis showed higher amounts of 18F-SMBT-1 binding in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain sections than in the control brain sections. 18F-SMBT-1 binding was completely displaced with reversible MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide, demonstrating the high selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 for MAO-B. Furthermore, 18F-SMBT-1 showed a high uptake by brain, rapid washout, and no radiolabeled metabolites in the brain of normal mice. SMBT-1 showed no significant binding to various receptors, ion channels, and transporters, and no toxic effects related to its administration were observed in mice and rats. Conclusion: 18F-SMBT-1 is a promising and selective MAO-B PET tracer candidate, which would be useful for quantitative monitoring of astrogliosis in the human brain.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",32646880,18F-SMBT-1,NULL,amyloid-β,NULL,NULL

6045,"[68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam: A Bisphosphonate PET Tracer with Facile Radiolabeling and Broad Calcium Mineral Affinity.","Calcium minerals such as hydroxyapatite (HAp) can be detected noninvasively in vivo using nuclear imaging agents such as [18F]NaF (available from cyclotrons), for positron emission tomography (PET) and 99mTc-radiolabeled bisphosphonates (BP; available from 99mTc generators for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or scintigraphy). These two types of imaging agents allow detection of bone metastases (based on the presence of HAp) and vascular calcification lesions (that contain HAp and other calcium minerals). With the aim of developing a cyclotron-independent PET radiotracer for these lesions, with broad calcium mineral affinity and simple one-step radiolabeling, we developed [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam. Radiolabeling with 68Ga is achieved using a mild single-step kit (5 min, room temperature, pH 7) to high radiochemical yield and purity (>95%). NMR studies demonstrate that Ga binds via the THP chelator, leaving the BP free to bind to its biological target. [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam shows high stability in human serum. The calcium mineral binding of [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam was compared in vitro to two other 68Ga-BPs which have been successfully evaluated in humans, [68Ga]Ga-NO2APBP and [68Ga]Ga-BPAMD, as well as [18F]NaF. Interestingly, we found that all 68Ga-BPs have a high affinity for a broad range of calcium minerals implicated in vascular calcification disease, while [18F]NaF is selective for HAp. Using healthy young mice as a model of metabolically active growing calcium mineral in vivo, we compared the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam with [18F]NaF as well as [68Ga]NO2APBP. These studies revealed that [68Ga]Ga-THP-Pam has high in vivo affinity for bone tissue (high bone/muscle and bone/blood ratios) and fast blood clearance (t1/2 < 10 min) comparable to both [68Ga]NO2APBP and [18F]NaF.

63798,"Validation of Parametric Methods for [11C]UCB-J PET Imaging Using Subcortical White Matter as Reference Tissue.","PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to evaluate different non-invasive methods for generating (R)-1-((3-([11C]methyl)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) ([11C]UCB-J) parametric maps using white matter (centrum semi-ovale-SO) as reference tissue.


PROCEDURES
Ten healthy volunteers (8 M/2F; age 27.6 ± 10.0 years) underwent a 90-min dynamic [11C]UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET) scan with full arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis before and after administration of a novel chemical entity with high affinity for presynaptic synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A). A simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2), multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM2), and reference Logan graphical analysis (rLGA) were used to generate binding potential maps using SO as reference tissue (BPSO). Shorter dynamic acquisitions down to 50 min were also considered. In addition, standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) relative to SO were evaluated for three post-injection intervals (SUVRSO,40-70min, SUVRSO,50-80min, and SUVRSO,60-90min respectively). Regional parametric BPSO + 1 and SUVRSO were compared with regional distribution volume ratios of a 1-tissue compartment model (1TCM DVRSO) using Spearman correlation and Bland-Altman analysis.


RESULTS
For all methods, highly significant correlations were found between regional, parametric BPSO + 1 (r = [0.63;0.96]) or SUVRSO (r = [0.90;0.91]) estimates and regional 1TCM DVRSO. For a 90-min dynamic scan, parametric SRTM2 and MRTM2 values presented similar small bias and variability (- 3.0 ± 2.9 % for baseline SRTM2) and outperformed rLGA (- 10.0 ± 5.3 % for baseline rLGA). Reducing the dynamic acquisition to 60 min had limited impact on the bias and variability of parametric SRTM2 BPSO estimates (- 1.0 ± 9.9 % for baseline SRTM2) while a higher variability (- 1.83 ± 10.8 %) for baseline MRTM2 was observed for shorter acquisition times. Both SUVRSO,60-90min and SUVRSO,50-80min showed similar small bias and variability (- 2.8 ± 4.6 % bias for baseline SUVRSO,60-90min).


CONCLUSION
SRTM2 is the preferred method for a voxelwise analysis of dynamic [11C]UCB-J PET using SO as reference tissue, while reducing the dynamic acquisition to 60 min has limited impact on [11C]UCB-J BPSO parametric maps. For a static PET protocol, both SUVRSO,60-90min and SUVRSO,50-80min images are an excellent proxy for [11C]UCB-J BPSO parametric maps.","Molecular imaging and biology",31209780,"[11C]UCB-J PET","[11C]UCB-J BPSO","SUVRSO,60",MRTM2,NULL

A rapid diagnosis followed by early antifungal treatment is essential for patient survival. Given the limited spectrum of biomarkers for invasive mold infections, recent studies have proposed the use of radiolabeled siderophores or antibodies as molecular probes to increase the specificity of radiological findings by nuclear imaging modalities. While holding enormous diagnostic potential, most of the currently available molecular probes are tailored to the detection of Aspergillus species, and their cost-intensive and sophisticated implementation restricts their accessibility at less specialized centers. In order to develop cost-efficient and broadly applicable tracers for pulmonary mold infections, this study established streamlined and high-yielding protocols to radiolabel amphotericin B (AMB) with the gamma emitter technetium-99m (99mTc-AMB) and the positron emitter gallium-68 (68Ga-AMB). The radiochemical purity of the resulting tracers consistently exceeded 99%, and both probes displayed excellent stability in human serum (>98% after 60 to 240 min at 37°C). The uptake kinetics by representative mold pathogens were assessed in an in vitro Transwell assay using infected endothelial cell layers. Both tracers accumulated intensively and specifically in Transwell inserts infected with Aspergillus fumigatus, Rhizopus arrhizus, and other clinically relevant mold pathogens compared with their accumulation in uninfected inserts and inserts infected with bacterial controls. Inoculum-dependent enrichment was confirmed by gamma counting and autoradiographic imaging. Taken together, this pilot in vitro study proposes 99mTc-AMB and 68Ga-AMB to be facile, stable, and specific probes, meriting further preclinical in vivo evaluation of radiolabeled amphotericin B for molecular imaging in invasive mycoses.","Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy",32393491,68Ga-AMB,"radiolabeled amphotericin B",°C,NULL,NULL

Previously, we have observed a correlation between the saliva and tumor metabolomic profiles in patients with oral cancer. Hence, if salivary metabolites demonstrate a significant correlation with PET parameters such as the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), they may have the potential to be used as a screening tool before PET/CT to identify patients with high SUVmax. Hence, in this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between salivary metabolites and SUVmax of 18F-FDG PET/CT using previously collected data. 18F-FDG PET/CT was performed for staging 26 patients with oral cancer. The collected data were integrated and analyzed along with quantified salivary hydrophilic metabolites obtained from the same patients with oral cancer and controls (n = 44). In total, 11 metabolites showed significant correlations with SUVmax in the delayed phases. A multiple logistic regression model of the two metabolites showed the ability to discriminate between patients with oral cancer and controls, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.738 (p = 0.001). This study uniquely confirmed a relationship between salivary metabolites and SUVmax of PET/CT in patients with oral cancer; salivary metabolites were significantly correlated with SUVmax.

YJH08 potently binds GR (Ki ∼ 0.4 nM) with ∼100-fold selectivity compared to nuclear hormone receptors in the same subfamily. 18F-YJH08 was prepared via Cu(OTf)2(py)4-mediated radiofluorination of an arylboronic acid pinacol ester with ∼12% decay corrected radiochemical yield from the starting 18F-fluoride ion. We applied treatment with the tissue-wide GR agonist dexamethasone and adrenalectomy and generated an adipocyte specific GR knockout mouse to show that 18F-YJH08 specifically binds GR in normal mouse tissues, including those for which aberrant GR expression is thought to drive severe diseases (e.g., brain, adipose tissue, kidneys). Remarkably, 18F-YJH08 PET also revealed that JG231, a potent and bioavailable HSP70 inhibitor, selectively degrades GR only in the adipose tissue of mice, a finding that foreshadows how GR targeted PET might be integrated into drug discovery to screen for selective GR modulation at the tissue level, beyond the historical screening that was performed at the transcriptional level.

Differential pharmacokinetics and comparable tumour affinities (within 1 h) were observed in AR42J tumour-bearing mice. Healthy volunteer imaging studies showed comparable distribution patterns of these two imaging agents. However, the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the two tracers varied in each organ. The two PET agents demonstrated almost identical SUVmax values in the kidneys. 68Ga-NOTA-TATE did have a lower SUVmax in most other organs compared with 68Ga-DOTA-TATE, including the liver (4.2 vs. 10.1), potentially due to the lower protein binding rate.


CONCLUSION
68Ga-NOTA-TATE and 68Ga-DOTA-TATE demonstrated comparable tumour uptake in an AR42J mouse model. An initial clinical study revealed that 68Ga-NOTA-TATE may have reduced background uptake in the major organs such as the liver. Although the subject numbers were limited, further investigation of 68Ga-NOTA-TATE is warranted for detecting SSTR2-positive neuroendocrine tumours.","EJNMMI research",32297029,68Ga-NOTA-TATE,"68Ga-labelled somatostatin analogues",NULL,NULL,NULL

AAZTA (1,4-bis (carboxymethyl)-6-[bis (carboxymethyl)]amino-6-methylperhydro-1,4-diazepine) based chelators were initially developed in the context of magnetic resonance imaging. First radiochemical studies showed the capability of AAZTA to form stable complexes with radiolanthanides and moderately stable complexes with 68Ga. For a systematic comparison of the labelling capabilities with current diagnostic and therapeutic trivalent radiometals, AAZTA5 (1,4-bis (carboxymethyl)-6-[bis (carboxymethyl)]amino-6-[pentanoic-acid]perhydro-1,4-diazepine) was synthesized representing a bifunctional version with a pentanoic acid at the carbon-6 atom. To evaluate the effect of adding a targeting vector (TV) to the bifunctional chelator on the complex formation, AAZTA5-TOC was synthesized, radiolabeled and tested in comparison to the uncoupled AAZTA5.


METHODS
AAZTA5 was synthesized in a 5-step synthesis. It was coupled to the cyclic peptide TOC (Phe1-Tyr3 octreotide) via amide bound formation. AAZTA and AAZTA5-TOC complex formations with 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu were investigated at different pH, temperature and precursor amounts. Stability studies against human serum, PBS buffer, EDTA and DTPA were performed.


RESULTS
AAZTA5 and AAZTA5-TOC achieved quantitative labelling (> 95%) at room temperature in less than 5 min with all three nuclides at pH ranges from 4 to 5.5 with low precursor amounts of 1 to 10 nmol. [44Sc]Sc-AAZTA5 complexes as well as [44Sc]Sc-AAZTA5-TOC were completely stable. The 177Lu complexes of AAZTA5 and AAZTA5-TOC showed high stability comparable to the 44Sc complexes. In contrast, the [68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5 complex stability was rather low, but interestingly, [68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5-TOC was completely stable.


CONCLUSION
AAZTA5 appears to be a promising bifunctional chelator for 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu with outstanding labelling capabilities at room temperature. Complex stabilities are high in the case of 44Sc and 177Lu. While [68Ga]Ga-AAZTA complexes alone lacking stability, [68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5-TOC demonstrated high stability. The latter indicates an interesting feature of [68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5-labelled radiopharmaceuticals.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",31659525,[68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5-TOC,"[68Ga]Ga-AAZTA5-labelled radiopharmaceuticals",NULL,NULL,NULL
52325,"Acetylcholinesterase-associated inflammation in patients with giant cell arteritis. Evaluation by histology and 11C-donepezil PET/CT.","OBJECTIVES
To investigate the in-situ expression of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the inflamed vessel wall of patients with biopsy-positive giant cell arteritis (GCA) as compared to biopsy-negative non-GCA patients, and to evaluate the in-vivo expression of AChE in patients with large-vessel GCA (LVGCA) by 11C-donepezil (AChE inhibitor) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).


METHODS
Twenty-four biopsy-positive GCA and 44 biopsy-negative non-GCA patients were included for AChE histology. Immunohistochemical methods were used to determine the AChE expression. The histological inflammation and the AChE expression were assessed by an experienced pathologist on a 3-point scale. Two patients with newly diagnosed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT verified LVGCA were included for 11C-donepezil PET/CT. PET images were assessed by an experienced nuclear medicine physician.


RESULTS
AChE was expressed in all 24 positive temporal artery biopsies, 10/24 showed high AChE expression (grade 2) and 14/24 showed moderate AChE expression (grade 1). No AChE expression was observed outside the media smooth muscle cells (grade 0) in any of the biopsy-negative non-GCA patients. The AChE expression was in 86% agreement with the histological inflammation. The AChE expression was not associated with any clinical or biochemical findings. In both LV-GCA patients, PET/CT revealed extensive vascular FDG uptake but no 11C-donepezil uptake.


CONCLUSIONS
AChE is highly expressed in the inflamed vessel wall of patients with GCA. Although, 11C-donepezil PET/CT showed no vascular uptake in the FDG PET/CT verified LV-GCA patients, histological findings raise the possibility that AChE can be used in the development of new diagnostic and disease monitoring tools for GCA.","Clinical and experimental rheumatology",31162030,11C-donepezil,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)",AChE,"FDG PET/CT",NULL
62435,"PET imaging of a 68Ga labeled modified HER2 affibody in breast cancers: from xenografts to patients.","OBJECTIVE
Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in breast cancers provides promising opportunities for imaging and targeted therapy. Developing HER2 targeted positron emission tomography (PET) probes might be benefit for management of the disease. Small high-affinity scaffold proteins, affibodies, are ideal vectors for imaging HER2 overexpressed tumors. Despite of the initial success on development of 18F labeled ZHER2:342 affibody, the tedious synthesis producers, low yields and unfavorable pharmacokinetics may hinder the clinical use. 68Ga is an attractive positron emitter for PET imaging. A simple preparation of 68Ga labeled ZHER2:342 analog, 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys-MZHER2:342, was reported in the study. The in vivo performances of the tracer for assessing HER2 status in breast cancers were also evaluated.


METHODS
NOTA-MAL conjugated Cys-MZHER2:342 was radiolabeled with 68Ga. The probe was evaluated by in vitro tests including stability and cell binding studies in breast cancer cells with different HER2 levels. In vivo evaluation was performed in mice bearing tumors using microPET imaging and biodistribution experiments. A PET/CT imaging study was initially performed in patients with breast cancers.


RESULTS
The tracer was synthesized in a straightforward chelation method with satisfactory non-decay corrected yield (81±5%) and radiochemical purity (>95%). In vivo micro-PET imaging showed that HER2 high levels expressed BT474 xenografts were more clear visualized than HER2 low levels expressed MCF-7 tumors (16.12 ± 2.69 ID%/g vs 1.32 ± 0.19 ID%/g at 1 h post-injection). The outcome was consistent with the immunohistochemical analysis. No significant radioactivity was accumulated in healthy tissues (less than 2% ID/g) except kidneys. In a preliminary clinical study, 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys-MZHER2:342 PET imaging allowed more high-contrast detection of HER2 positive primary tumors (maximum standardized uptake value = 2.16±0.27) than those in HER2 negative primary focus (maximum standardized uptake value = 0.32±0.05). No detectable side-effects were found.


CONCLUSION
In summary, this study indicates the significant efficiency of the 68Ga labeled HER2 affibody. Preclinical and clinical studies support the possibility of monitoring HER2 levels in breast cancers using 68Ga-NOTA-MAL-Cys-MZHER2:342.

Although 18F-PSMA-11 has already been evaluated in a Phase I and Phase II clinical trial, preclinical evaluation of this radiotracer is important for further understanding its dynamic behavior. Saturation binding experiments were conducted by incubation of LNCaP cells with 18F-PSMA-11 or 68Ga-PSMA-11 for 1 h, followed by determination of the specific and aspecific binding. Mice bearing LNCaP or PC-3 xenografts each received ± 3.7 MBq 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 followed by dynamic acquisition of 2.5 h as well as ± 15 MBq 18F-FDG followed by static acquisition at 1 h post injection (p.i.). Uptake was evaluated by comparison of uptake parameters (SUVmean, SUVmax, TBRmean and TBRmax). Mice underwent ex vivo biodistribution where 18F-PSMA-11 activity was measures in excretory organs (kidneys, bladder and liver) as well as bone fragments (femur, humerus, sternum and skull) to evaluate bone uptake. The dissociation constant (Kd) of 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11 was 2.95 ± 0.87 nM and 0.49 ± 0.20 nM, respectively. Uptake parameters were significantly higher in LNCaP compared to PC-3 xenografts for both 18F-PSMA-11 and 68Ga-PSMA-11, while no difference was found for 18F-FDG uptake (except for SUVmax). Tumor uptake of 18F-PSMA-11 showed a similar trend over time as 68Ga-PSMA-11, although all uptake parameter curves of the latter were considerably lower. When comparing early (60 min p.i.) to delayed (150 min p.i.) imaging for both radiotracers individually, TBRmean and TBRmax were significantly higher at the later timepoint, as well as the SUVmax of 68Ga-PSMA-11. The highest %ID/g was determined in the kidneys (94.0 ± 13.6%ID/g 1 h p.i.) and the bladder (6.48 ± 2.18%ID/g 1 h p.i.). No significant increase in bone uptake was seen between 1 and 2 h p.i. Both radiotracers showed high affinity for the PSMA receptor. Over time, all uptake parameters were higher for 18F-PSMA-11 compared to 68Ga-PSMA-11. Delayed imaging with the latter may improve tumor visualization, while no additional benefits could be found for late 18F-PSMA-11 imaging. Ex vivo biodistribution demonstrated fast renal clearance of 18F-PSMA-11 as well as no significant increase in bone uptake.","Scientific reports",33273603,18F-PSMA-11,"18F-labeled derivative","PSMA receptor",NULL,"PC-3 xenografts"
1564,"Labeling a TCO-functionalized single domain antibody fragment with 18F via inverse electron demand Diels Alder cycloaddition using a fluoronicotinyl moiety-bearing tetrazine derivative.","Single domain antibody fragments (sdAbs) exhibit a rapid tumor uptake and fast blood clearance amenable for labeling with 18F (t½ = 110 min) but suffer from high kidney accumulation. Previously, we developed a method for 18F-labeling of sdAbs via trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-tetrazine (Tz) inverse electron demand Diel's Alder cycloaddition reaction (IEDDAR) that incorporated a renal brush border enzyme (RBBE)-cleavable linker. Although >15 fold reduction in kidney activity levels was achieved, tumor uptake was compromised. Here we investigate whether replacing the [18F]AlF-NOTA moiety with [18F]fluoronicotinyl would rectify this problem. Anti-HER2 sdAb 5F7 was first derivatized with a TCO-containing agent that included the RBBE-cleavable linker GlyLys (GK) and a PEG chain, and then subjected to IEDDAR with 6-[18F]fluoronicotinyl-PEG4-methyltetrazine to provide [18F]FN-PEG4-Tz-TCO-GK-PEG4-5F7 ([18F]FN-GK-5F7). For comparisons, a control lacking GK linker and 5F7 labeled using residualizing N-succinimidyl 3-guanidinomethyl-5-[125I]iodobenzoate (iso-[125I]SGMIB) also were synthesized. Radiochemical purity, affinity (KD) and immunoreactive fraction of [18F]FN-GK-5F7 were 99%, 5.4 ± 0.7 nM and 72.5 ± 4.3%, respectively.

However, due to its 6-fold lower kidney activity levels, tumor-to-kidney ratios for [18F]FN-GK-5F7 were 3-4 times higher than those for co-injected iso-[125I]SGMIB-5F7 as well as those observed for the 18F conjugate lacking the RBBE-cleavable linker. Micro-PET/CT imaging of [18F]FN-GK-5F7 in mice with SKOV-3 subcutaneous xenografts clearly delineated tumor as early as 1 h with minimal activity in the kidneys; however, there was considerable activity in gallbladder and intestines. Although the tumor uptake of [18F]FN-GK-5F7 was unexpectedly disappointing, incorporating an alternative RBBE-cleavable linker into this labeling strategy may ameliorate this problem.","Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry",32773089,[18F]FN-GK-5F7,[18F]FN-PEG4-Tz-TCO-GK-PEG4-5F7,IEDDAR,NULL,NULL

In vivo tau-PET tracer retention in the anterior temporal lobe of patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV PPA) has consistently been reported. This is unexpected as the majority of these patients have frontotemporal lobar degeneration TDP (FTLD-TDP).


METHODS
We conducted an in vitro [18F]AV1451 autoradiography binding study in five cases with a clinical diagnosis of SV PPA constituting the range of pathologies (i.e., three FTLD-TDP, one Alzheimer's disease (AD), and one Pick's disease (PiD)). Binding was compared with two controls without neurodegeneration, two typical AD, one corticobasal syndrome with underlying AD, and one frontotemporal dementia behavioral variant with FTLD-TDP. The effect of blocking with the authentic reference material and with the MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl was assessed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on adjacent cryosections.


RESULTS
Absence of specific [18F]AV1451 binding was observed for all three SV PPA FTLD-TDP cases. The absence of binding in controls as well as the successful blocking with authentic AV1451 in cases with tauopathy demonstrated specificity of the [18F]AV1451 signal for tau. The specific [18F]AV1451 binding was highest in AD, followed by PiD. This binding colocalized with the respective tau lesions and could not be blocked by deprenyl. Similar pilot findings were obtained with [18F]THK5351.


CONCLUSION
In vitro autoradiography showed no [18F]AV1451 binding in SV PPA due to FTLD-TDP, while specific binding was present in SV PPA due to AD and PiD.

We investigated such heterogeneity in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with [18F]fluoromethyl-(1,2-2H4) choline ([18F]D4-FCH) and positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT).

Results: Oxidation of [18F]D4-FCH to [18F]D4-fluorobetaine was suppressed (48.58±0.31% parent at 60 min) likely due to the deuterium isotope effect embodied within the design of the radiotracer.

To assess the diagnostic performance of simultaneous whole-body 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compared to [18F]FDG PET/x-ray computed tomography (CT) for detection of distant metastatic disease in patients with malignant melanoma.


PROCEDURES
We included patients with malignant melanoma who underwent a single injection [18F]FDG dual-imaging protocol that included whole-body PET/CT and subsequent whole-body PET/MRI for staging or restaging purposes in a prospective setting. Images from both modalities were analyzed by two rater teams for the presence of metastatic lesions. PET/CT-PET/MRI overall agreement as well as region-based accuracies, sensitivities (Se), and specificities (Sp) were computed.


RESULTS
Between July 2014 and December 2018, 22 patients were enrolled. Interrater agreement and overall accuracy (consensus reading) were 78.8 % (95 % CI 71-84.9) and 96.1 % (95 % CI 92.3-98) for PET/MRI and 78 % (70.2-84.3) and 97.4 % (95 % CI 93.7-98.9) for PET/CT, respectively (P = 0.42).

59215,"PET Imaging for Dynamically Monitoring Neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 Mouse Model Using [18F]DPA714.","Background: In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia play an increasingly important role. Molecular imaging of neuroinflammatory targeting microglia activation and the high expression of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become a hot topic of research in recent years. Dynamic monitoring neuroinflammation is crucial for discovering the best time point of anti-inflammatory therapy. Motivated by this, Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, using 18F-labeled DPA-714 to monitor microglia activation and neuroinflammation, were performed in this paper. Methods: We prepared [18F]DPA714 and tested the biological characteristics of the molecular probe in normal mice. To obtain a higher radiochemical yield, we improved the [18F]-fluorination conditions in the precursor dosage, reaction temperature, and synthesis time. We performed [18F]DPA714 PET scanning on APP/PS1 mice at 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, and 15-16 months of age, respectively. The same experiments were conducted in Wild-type (Wt) mice as a control. Referring to the [18F]DPA714 concentrated situation in the brain, we performed blocking experiments with PK11195 (1 mg/kg) in 12-13-months-old APP/PS1 mice to confirm the specificity of [18F]DPA714 for TSPO in the APP/PS1 mice. Reconstructed brain PET images, fused with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) template atlas, and the volumes of interests (VOIs) of the hippocampus and cortex were determined. The distribution of [18F]DPA714 in the brain tissues of 15-16-months-old APP/PS1 and Wt mice were studied by immunofluorescence staining. Results: Through the reaction of 18F, with 2 mg precursor dissolved in 300 ul acetonitrile at 105°C for 10 min, we obtained the optimal radiochemical yield of 42.3 ± 5.1% (non-decay correction). Quantitative analysis of brain PET images showed that the [18F]DPA714 uptake in the cortex and hippocampus of 12-13-months-old APP/PS1 mice was higher than that of the control mice of the same age (cortex/muscle: 2.77 ± 0.13 vs. 1.93 ± 0.32, p = 0.0014; hippocampus/muscle: 3.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.10 ± 0.35, p = 0.0008). The same significant difference was found between 15- and 16-months-old APP/PS1 mice (cortex/muscle: 2.64 ± 0.14 vs. 1.86 ± 0.52, p=0.0159; hippocampus/muscle: 2.89 ± 0.53 vs. 1.77 ± 0.48, p = 0.0050).

Improved Risk Stratification for MRI-Guided Transrectal Prostate Biopsies.","A prospective single-arm clinical trial was conducted to determine whether 18F-choline PET/mpMRI can improve the specificity of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) of the prostate for Gleason ≥ 3+4 prostate cancer. Methods: Before targeted and systematic prostate biopsy, mpMRI and 18F-choline PET/CT were performed on 56 evaluable subjects with 90 Likert score 3-5 mpMRI target lesions, using a 18F-choline target-to-background ratio of greater than 1.58 to indicate a positive 18F-choline result. Prostate biopsies were performed after registration of real-time transrectal ultrasound with T2-weighted MRI. A mixed-effects logistic regression was applied to measure the performance of mpMRI (based on prospective Likert and retrospective Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System, version 2 [PI-RADS], scores) compared with 18F-choline PET/mpMRI to detect Gleason ≥ 3+4 cancer. Results: The per-lesion accuracy of systematic plus targeted biopsy for mpMRI alone was 67.8% (area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC], 0.73) for Likert 4-5 and 70.0% (AUC, 0.76) for PI-RADS 3-5.

64695,"Quantification of SV2A Binding in Rodent Brain Using [18F]SynVesT-1 and PET Imaging.","PURPOSE
Synapse loss is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and correlates with cognitive decline. The validation of a noninvasive in vivo imaging approach to quantify synapse would greatly facilitate our understanding of AD pathogenesis and assist drug developments for AD. As animal models of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders play a critical role in the drug discovery and development process, a robust, objective, and translational method for quantifying therapeutic drug efficacy in animal models will facilitate the drug development process. In this study, we tested the quantification reliability of the SV2A PET tracer, [18F]SynVesT-1, in a mouse model of AD (APP/PS1) and wild-type controls, and developed a simplified quantification method to facilitate large cohort preclinical imaging studies.


PROCEDURES
We generated nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) and distribution volume ratio (DVR) values using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) on the 90-min dynamic PET imaging data, with brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. Then, we correlated the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)-1 and SUVR averaged from different imaging windows with BPND and DVR, using brain stem and cerebellum as the reference region, respectively. We performed homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay using [18F]SynVesT-1 to calculate the Bmax and Kd.


RESULTS
Using brain stem as the reference region, the averaged SUVR-1 from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the BPND calculated using SRTM. Using cerebellum as the reference region, the averaged SUVR from 30 to 60 min postinjection correlated well with the SRTM DVR. From the homologous competitive binding assay and autoradiographic saturation binding assay, the calculated the Bmax and Kd were 4.5-18 pmol/mg protein and 9.8-19.6 nM, respectively, for rodent brain tissue.


CONCLUSIONS
This simplified SUVR method provides reasonable SV2A measures in APP/PS1 mice and their littermate controls. Our data indicate that, in lieu of a full 90-min dynamic scan, a 30-min static PET scan (from 30 to 60 min postinjection) would be sufficient to provide quantification data on SV2A expression, equivalent to the data generated from kinetic modeling. The methods developed here are readily applicable to the evaluation of therapeutic effects of novel drugs in this rodent model using [18F]SynVesT-1 and small animal PET.","Molecular imaging and biology",33258040,[18F]SynVesT-1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

29944,"TSPO imaging-guided characterization of the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor microenvironment in patients with malignant glioma.","BACKGROUND
Tumor-associated microglia and macrophages (TAMs) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are potent immunosuppressors in the glioma tumor microenvironment (TME). Their infiltration is associated with tumor grade, progression, and therapy resistance. Specific tools for image-guided analysis of spatiotemporal changes in the immunosuppressive myeloid tumor compartments are missing. We aimed (i) to evaluate the role of fluorodeoxyglucose (18F)DPA-714* (translocator protein [TSPO]) PET-MRI in the assessment of the immunosuppressive TME in glioma patients, and (ii) to cross-correlate imaging findings with in-depth immunophenotyping.


METHODS
To characterize the glioma TME, a mixed collective of 9 glioma patients underwent [18F]DPA-714-PET-MRI in addition to [18F]fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine (FET)-PET-MRI. Image-guided biopsy samples were immunophenotyped by multiparametric flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In vitro autoradiography was performed for image validation and assessment of tracer binding specificity.


RESULTS
We found a strong relationship (r = 0.84, P = 0.009) between the [18F]DPA-714 uptake and the number and activation level of glioma-associated myeloid cells (GAMs). TSPO expression was mainly restricted to human leukocyte antigen D related-positive (HLA-DR+) activated GAMs, particularly to tumor-infiltrating HLA-DR+ MDSCs and TAMs. [18F]DPA-714-positive tissue volumes exceeded [18F]FET-positive volumes and showed a differential spatial distribution.


CONCLUSION
[18F]DPA-714-PET may be used to non-invasively image the glioma-associated immunosuppressive TME in vivo. This imaging paradigm may also help to characterize the heterogeneity of the glioma TME with respect to the degree of myeloid cell infiltration at various disease stages.

First pilot studies with 68Ga-pentixafor, a novel CXCR4-directed PET tracer, have shown promise to noninvasively image inflammation within atherosclerotic plaques. The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the performance of 68Ga-pentixafor PET/CT for imaging atherosclerosis in comparison to 18F-FDG PET/CT. Methods: Ninety-two patients (37 women and 55 men; mean age, 62 ± 10 y) underwent 68Ga-pentixafor and 18F-FDG PET/CT for staging of oncologic diseases. In these subjects, lesions in the walls of large arteries were identified using morphologic and PET criteria for atherosclerosis (n = 652). Tracer uptake was measured and adjusted for vascular lumen (background) signal by calculation of target-to-background ratios (TBRs) by 2 investigators masked to the other PET scan. On a lesion-to-lesion and patient basis, the TBRs of both PET tracers were compared and additionally correlated to the degree of arterial calcification as quantified in CT. Results: On a lesion-to-lesion basis, 68Ga-pentixafor and 18F-FDG uptake showed a weak correlation (r = 0.28; P < 0.01). 68Ga-pentixafor PET identified more lesions (n = 290; TBR ≥ 1.6, P < 0.01) and demonstrated higher uptake than 18F-FDG PET (1.8 ± 0.5 vs. 1.4 ± 0.4; P < 0.01).

53370,"Is whole body low dose CT still necessary in the era of 18F-FDG PET/CT for the assessment of bone disease in multiple myeloma patients?","OBJECTIVE
Whole body low dose computed tomography (WBLDCT) is the first-choice imaging modality to identify bone involvement in multiple myeloma (MM). Because the unenhanced LDCT co-registered to positron emission tomography (PET) (LDCT/PET) has similar technical characteristics to WBLDCT, we aimed to assess its reliability in the detection of bone disease, for employing fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET/CT as unique multimodality imaging method in MM patients.


SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Thirty three consecutive MM patients were prospectively enrolled and evaluated with WBLDCT to assess bone involvement. In addition, patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT using a disease-tailored optimized LDCT protocol. To compare both methods, skeletal anatomical regions were identified and a per-region and per-patient analysis were performed using Cohen's k test. Low dose computed tomography/PET sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were also calculated.


RESULTS
The two imaging modalities resulted highly concordant considering both patient-based (k=0.841) and region-based analysis; some discrepancies were observed in dorsal spine (k=0.809) and thorax (k=0.756). Low dose computed tomography/PET sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 89.4%, 98.3% and 93.5%, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Low dose computed tomography co-registered PET has comparable performance to WBLDCT. If confirmed on a lager sample, these encouraging results suggest the possibility to use this multimodal hybrid imaging as the only method for MM evaluation, rather than both exams, providing both morphologic and metabolic information in one session with impact on patient compliance, health care spending and especially radiation exposure.","Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine",33306757,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL

[18F]THK-5351 was originally developed as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer for the detection of accumulated tau proteins, the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, clinical studies of [18F]THK-5351 revealed the existence of off-target binding to monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B). To overcome this off-target binding, in this work, we synthesized and evaluated 2-pyrrolopyridinylquinoline (PPQ) derivatives as selective tau PET imaging tracers.


METHODS
The core structure of PPQ derivatives was synthesized mainly using the Buchwald-Hartwig amination coupling reaction. All derivatives were evaluated for binding affinity towards tau and MAO-B by in vitro competitive binding assay. Radiosynthesis of PPQ derivatives was performed by 18F-radiolabeling of their tosylate precursors with activated [18F]KF/Kryptofix222 complex in dimethylsulfoxide by heating at 110 °C for 10 min. The biological properties of these [18F]PPQ derivatives were characterized by in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections and by assay of ex vivo biodistribution in mice.


RESULTS
The PPQ derivatives were synthesized, with yields of 49-84%. In vitro competitive binding assay revealed that two novel PPQ derivatives-PPQ8 and PPQ9-demonstrated high binding affinity for tau (IC50 = 4.9 and 6.9 nM, respectively). The radiosynthesis of [18F]PPQ8 and [18F]PPQ9 yielded 1.4% and 50.1% isolated non-decay corrected radiochemical yield, respectively, with >99% radiochemical purity. The molar radioactivities of [18F]PPQ8 and [18F]PPQ9 were 16.9 and 64.8 GBq/μmol, respectively. The in vitro and ex vivo biological characterization of [18F]PPQ8 and [18F]PPQ9 revealed that these tracers were selective for tau in AD brain sections without off-target binding, and they furthermore demonstrated brain uptake in normal mice.


CONCLUSIONS
18F-labeled PPQ derivatives improved binding affinity and selectivity for tau aggregates in AD. Further structural optimization to improve pharmacokinetics for potent tau PET imaging tracers is required.","Nuclear medicine and biology",33221641,[18F]PPQ9,"18F-labeled PPQ derivatives",NULL,NULL,NULL

36145,"PET Detection of Cerebral Necrosis Using an Infarct-Avid Agent 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]Fluoro-D-Glucaric Acid (FGA) in a Mouse Model of the Brain Stroke.","PURPOSE
Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of disability worldwide. The volume of necrotic core in affected tissue plays a major role in selecting stroke patients for thrombolytic therapy or endovascular thrombectomy. In this study, we investigated a recently reported positron emission tomography (PET) agent 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucaric acid (FGA) to determine necrotic core in a model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (t-MCAO) in mice.


PROCEDURES
The radiopharmaceutical, FGA, was synthesized by controlled, rapid, and quantitative oxidation of clinical doses of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) in a one-step reaction using a premade kit. Brain stroke was induced in the left cerebral hemisphere of CD-1 mice by occluding the middle cerebral artery for 1 h, and then allowing reperfusion by removing the occlusion. One day post-ictus, perfusion single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) was performed with 99mTc-lableled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO), followed by PET acquisition with FGA. Plasma and brain tissue homogenates were assayed for markers of inflammation and neurotrophins.


RESULTS
The kit-based synthesis was able to convert up to 2.2 GBq of FDG into FGA within 5 min. PET images showed 375 % more accumulation of FGA in the ipsilateral hemisphere than in the contralateral hemisphere. SPECT images showed that the ipsilateral HMPAO accumulation was reduced to 55 % of normal levels; there was a significant negative correlation between the ipsilateral accumulation of FGA and HMAPO (p < 0.05). FGA accumulation in stroke also correlated with IL-6 levels in the ipsilateral hemisphere. There was no change in IL-6 or TNFα in the plasma of stroke mice.


CONCLUSIONS
Accumulation of FGA correlated well with the perfusion defect and inflammatory injury. As a PET agent, FGA has potential to image infarcted core in the brain stroke injury with high sensitivity, resolution, and specificity.","Molecular imaging and biology",32557188,2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose,"99mTc-lableled hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime",IL-6,FGA,NULL

Synthesis of the precursors could be achieved with a 13% and 11% yield and radiolabelling generally afforded rapid incorporation under mild conditions (>95%). Stability in physiological media (~75% after 2 h in human blood for [68Ga]Ga-/[44Sc]Sc-AAZTA-PC21 and ~60% for [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-C21, respectively) are generally enhanced if compared to the previously radiolabelled analogues. MSn fragmentation experiments showed high stability of the AAZTA-PC21 structure mainly due to the pyrazole derivatization of the curcumin keto-enol moiety and a more feasible radiolabelling was noticed both with gallium-68 and scandium-44 mainly due to the AAZTA-chelator properties. [68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-C21 showed the most favorable lipophilicity value (logD = 1.3). Due to these findings, both compounds appear to be promising candidates for the imaging of colorectal cancer, but further studies such as in vitro uptake and in vivo biodistribution experiments are needed.","Journal of inorganic biochemistry",31838188,[68Ga]Ga-NODAGA-C21,"gallium-68 and scandium-44",NODAGA,NULL,NULL
51166,"Instant kit preparation of 68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals via the hybrid chelator DATA: clinical translation of [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC.","PURPOSE
The widespread use of 68Ga for positron emission tomography (PET) relies on the development of radiopharmaceutical precursors that can be radiolabelled and dispensed in a simple, quick, and convenient manner. The DATA (6-amino-1,4-diazapine-triacetate) scaffold represents a novel hybrid chelator architecture possessing both cyclic and acyclic character that may allow for facile access to 68Ga-labelled tracers in the clinic. We report the first bifunctional DATA chelator conjugated to [Tyr3]octreotide (TOC), a somatostatin subtype 2 receptor (SST2)-targeting vector for imaging and functional characterisation of SSTR2 expressing tumours.


METHODS
The radiopharmaceutical precursor, DATA-TOC, was synthesised as previously described and used to complex natGa(III) and 68Ga(III). Competition binding assays of [natGa]Ga-DATA-TOC or [natGa]Ga-DOTA-TOC against [125I-Tyr25]LTT-SS28 were conducted in membranes of HEK293 cells transfected to stably express one of the hSST2,3,5 receptor subtypes (HEK293-hSST2/3/5 cells). First in vivo studies were performed in female NMRI-nude mice bearing SST2-positive mouse phaeochromocytoma mCherry (MPC-mCherry) tumours to compare the in vivo SST2-specific tumour-targeting of [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC and its overall pharmacokinetics versus the [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC reference. A direct comparison of [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC with the well-established PET radiotracer [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC was additionally performed in a 46-year-old male patient with a well-differentiated NET (neuroendocrine tumour), representing the first in human administration of [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC.


RESULTS
DATA-TOC was labelled with 68Ga with a radiolabelling efficiency of > 95% in less than 10 min at ambient temperature. A molar activity up to 35 MBq/nmol was achieved. The hSST2-affinities of [natGa]Ga-DATA-TOC and [natGa]Ga-DOTA-TOC were found similar with only sub-nanomolar differences in the respective IC50 values. In mice, [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was able to visualise the tumour lesions, showing standardised uptake values (SUVs) similar to [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC. Direct comparison of the two PET tracers in a NET patient revealed very similar tumour uptake for the two 68Ga-radiotracers, but with a higher tumour-to-liver contrast for [68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC.


CONCLUSION
[68Ga]Ga-DATA-TOC was prepared, to a quality appropriate for in vivo use, following a highly efficient kit type process. Furthermore, the novel radiopharmaceutical was comparable or better than [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC in all preclinical tests, achieving a higher tumour-to-liver contrast in a NET-patient. The results illustrate the potential of the DATA-chelator to facilitate the access to and preparation of 68Ga-radiotracers in a routine clinical radiopharmacy setting.","EJNMMI research",31123943,68Ga-radiotracers,"68Ga-radiotracers,",hSST2-affinities,NULL,"HEK293-hSST2/3/5 cells"

The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of white blood cell scintigraphy (WBC), 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ((18F) FDG PET/CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in patients with suspected DFI. Images and clinical data from 251 patients enrolled by five centers were collected in order to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of WBC, FDG, and MRI in diagnosing osteomyelitis (OM), soft-tissue infection (STI), and Charcot osteoarthropathy. In OM, WBC acquired following the European Society of Nuclear Medicine (EANM) guidelines was more specific and accurate than MRI (91.9% vs. 70.7%, p < 0.0001 and 86.2% vs. 67.1%, p = 0.003, respectively). In STI, both FDG and WBC achieved a significantly higher specificity than MRI (97.9% and 95.7% vs. 83.6%, p = 0.04 and p = 0.018, respectively). In Charcot, both MRI and WBC demonstrated a significantly higher specificity and accuracy than FDG (88.2% and 89.3% vs. 62.5%, p = 0.0009; 80.3% and 87.9% vs. 62.1%, p < 0.02, respectively). Moreover, in Charcot, WBC was more specific than MRI (89.3% vs. 88.2% p < 0.0001).

72859,"PET quantification of brain O-GlcNAcase with [18F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers.","BACKGROUND
Previous studies found that [18F]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [18F]LSN3316612 for human clinical research.


METHODS
Kinetic evaluation of [18F]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (VT) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of VT was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [18F]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling.


RESULTS
Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as VT with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [18F]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of VT on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. VT values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional VT values during test-retest conditions (R2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to VT (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [18F]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 ± 2.1 μSv/MBq, comparable to other 18F-labeled radioligands for brain imaging.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of VT under retest conditions requires further investigation.","EJNMMI research",32172476,[18F]LSN3316612,"18F-labeled radioligands",μSv/MBq,NULL,NULL

Facilitating biological research and molecular imaging was the driving force when [11C]carbon monoxide was used in the first in vivo application with carbon-11 in human (1945) and when [11C]carbon monoxide was used for the first time as a chemical reagent in the synthesis of [11C]phosgene (1978). This review examines a rich plethora of labelled compounds synthesized from [11C]carbon monoxide, their chemistry and use in molecular imaging. While the strong development of the 11C-carbonylation chemistry has expanded the carbon-11 domain considerably, it could be argued that the number of 11C-carbonyl compounds entering biological investigations should be higher. The reason for this may partly be the lack of commercially available synthesis instruments designed for 11C-carbonylations. But as this review shows, novel and greatly simplified methods to handle [11C]carbon monoxide have been developed. The next important challenge is to make full use of these technologies and synthesis methods in PET research.

The ex vivo biodistribution profile of 11C-VA426 was evaluated in the brain and periphery of healthy rats and mice and in brain and periphery of inflammation models, based on the administration of LPS. 11C-VA426 synthesis with the tBuOK base showed optimal radiochemical yield (15 ± 2%) based on triflate activity, molar activity (range 37-148 GBq/μmol), and radiochemical purity (>95%). Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed a fast uptake of radioactivity but a rapid washout, except in regions expressing COX-2 (lungs, liver, and kidney) both in rats and in mice, with maximum values at 30 and 10 minutes p.i., respectively. LPS administration did not show significant effect on radioactivity accumulation. Celecoxib competition experiments performed in rats and mice treated with LPS produced a general target unrelated reduction of radioactivity concentration in all peripheral tissues and brain areas examined. Finally, in agreement with the negative results obtained from biodistribution experiments, radiometabolites analysis revealed that 11C-VA426 is highly unstable in vivo.

To study the imaging parameters of 18F-fluorodeoxy glucose (18F-FDG) in breast cancer on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT)-the correlation of clinical pathological factors and prognosis among the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) of lesions for patients.


METHODS
From January 2012 to December 2014, a total of 125 female patients were treated in our hospital for the first time and were diagnosed as breast cancer by histopathology. They were selected as the research subjects. All of them had complete 18F-FDG PET/CT examination data before surgery, the postoperative clinicopathological information, and follow-up data. They were divided into the event group (38 cases) and the event-free group (87 cases) according to whether local recurrence or distant metastasis occurred after the follow-up, with the follow-up time 4-60 months. The correlation on 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters of breast cancer with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was retrospectively evaluated.


RESULTS
The primary lesions of 125 cases with breast cancers all had higher 18F-FDG uptake, and the SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of the primary tumors in the event group were significantly higher than those in the event-free group (t = 2.645, 2.782, 15.263, p = 0.011, 0.008, 0.000), p < 0.05; SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of primary breast cancer have no correlation with age and tumor site of patient (p > 0.05); there were statistically significant differences in the SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of primary tumor in the comparison of different tumor size, T stage, N stage, and histological grades (p < 0.05); all of SUVmax, MTV, and TLG in the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) positive groups were lower than those in the negative group, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05); the SUVmax, MTV, and TLG of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive group, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Ki-67) high expression group were higher than those in the negative group and low expression group, with statistically significant difference (p < 0.05).

Therefore, MMP imaging-for example, with radiolabeled MMP inhibitors (MMPIs)-potentially represents a valuable tool for clinical diagnostics using noninvasive single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Despite numerous preclinical imaging approaches, translation to a clinical setting has not yet been successful. We introduce and oppose three potential radiofluorinated MMP-targeted imaging probes, modified by the introduction of pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) dyes and therefore containing both radio- as well as fluorescent label with respect to their capability to assess MMP activity in vivo by means of scintigraphic (PET) and/or fluorescent (NIRF) imaging. New hybrid MMPI tracer candidates, structurally based on radiofluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones (barbiturates) from previous approaches, were synthesized by convenient two-step syntheses. In the first step, Cy5 dyes, varying in the number of sulfonate groups (nSO = 1, 2, or 4) and bearing an additional "clickable" alkyne moiety, were coupled to the barbiturate MMPI by amide formation. In the second step, the [18F]fluoride radiolabel was introduced into the resulting Cy5 dye conjugates by "radio-click" chemistry. Biodistribution studies of these hybrid tracer candidates were assessed and compared in C57BL/6 mice by PET as well as fluorescence imaging. MMP activity was imaged in a MMP-positive mouse model of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) by PET and sequential fluorescence reflectance imaging (FRI), respectively. In vivo data were validated by scintillation counting, gelatin zymography, and MMP-histology. Three new potential hybrid MMP imaging probes were prepared, differing essentially in the number of sulfonate groups, introduced by Cy5 dye components. Although the hydrophilicity of these compounds was substantially increased, 10a (nSO = 1) and 10b (nSO = 2) were still rapidly eliminated via unfavorable hepatobiliary pathways, as observed in earlier approaches. Only 11 (nSO = 4) showed delayed in vivo clearance and a shift towards higher renal elimination.

Methods: In this retrospective institution-approved study, 94 patients addressed for initial staging of lung cancer with suspicion of PLC were included. Using double-blind analysis, we assessed the presence of signs favoring PLC on HRCT (smooth or nodular septal lines, subpleural nodularity, peribronchovascular thickening, satellite nodules, lymph node enlargement, and pleural effusion). 18F-FDG PET/CT images were reviewed to qualitatively evaluate peritumoral uptake and to quantify tracer uptake in the tumoral and peritumoral areas. Histology performed on surgical specimens served as the gold standard for all patients. Results: Among 94 included patients, 73% (69/94) had histologically confirmed PLC. Peribronchovascular thickening, lymph node involvement, and increased peritumoral uptake were more often present in patients with PLC (P < 0.009). Metabolic variables, including tumor SUVmax, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis, as well as peritumoral SUVmax, SUVmean, and their respective ratios to background, were significantly higher in the PLC group than in the non-PLC group (P ≤ 0.0039).

Biodistribution studies revealed strong tumor uptake and retention of [18F]DMPY2 (24.8% injected dose per gram of tissue [ID/g] at 60 min) and [18F]DMPY3 (11.7%ID/g at 60 min) in B16F10 xenografts. MicroPET imaging of both agents demonstrated strong tumoral uptake/retention and rapid washout, resulting in excellent tumor-to-background contrast in B16F10 xenografts. In particular, [18F]DMPY2 clearly visualized almost all metastatic lesions in lung and lymph nodes, with excellent image quality. [18F]DMPY2 demonstrated a significantly higher tumor-to-liver ratio than [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and the previously reported benzamide tracers N-[2-(diethylamino)-ethyl]-5-[18F]fluoropicolinamide ([18F]P3BZA) and N-[2-(diethylamino)-ethyl]-4-[18F]fluorobenzamide ([18F]FBZA) in B16F10-bearing or SK-MEL-3 (human melanoma)-bearing mice.

The β-amyloid radiotracer [11C] PiB is extensively used for the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias. For clinical use, [11C] PiB is produced using the 11C-methylation method ([11C] Methyl iodide or [11C] methyl triflate as 11C-methylation agents), which represents the most employed 11C-labelling strategy for the synthesis of 11C-radiopharmaceuticals. Recently, the use of direct [11C]CO2 fixation for the syntheses of 11C-tracers has gained interest in the radiochemical community due to its importance in terms of radiochemical versatility and for permitting the direct employment of the cyclotron-produced precursor [11C]CO2. This paper presents an optimised alternative one-pot methodology of [11C]CO2 fixation-reduction for the rapid synthesis of [11C] PiB using an automated commercial platform and its quality control.


RESULTS
[11C] PiB was obtained from a (25.9 ± 13.2)% (Average ± Variation Coefficient, n = 3) (end of synthesis, decay corrected) radiochemical yield from trapped [11C]CO2 after 1 min of labelling time using PhSiH3 / TBAF as the fixation-reduction system in Diglyme at 150 °C. The radiochemical purity was higher than 95% in all cases, and the molar activity was (61.4 ± 1.6) GBq/μmol. The radiochemical yield and activity (EOS) of formulated [11C] PiB from cyclotron-produced [11C]CO2 was (14.8 ± 12.1)%, decay corrected) and 9.88 GBq (± 6.0%), respectively. These are higher values compared to that of the 11C-methylation method with [11C]CH3OTf (~ 8.3%).


CONCLUSIONS
The viability of the system PhSiH3 / TBAF to efficiently promote the radiosynthesis of [11C] PiB via direct [11C]CO2 fixation-reduction has been demonstrated. [11C] PiB was obtained through a fully automated radiosynthesis with a satisfactory yield, purity and molar activity. According to the results, the one-pot methodology employed could reliably yield sufficiently high tracer amounts for preclinical and clinical use.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",31659494,[11C]CH3OTf,"[11C] PiB",EOS,NULL,NULL
56965,"Initial Physician Experience with [18F]Flutemetamol Amyloid PET Imaging Following Availability for Routine Clinical Use in Japan.","Background
Brain amyloid is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). By visualizing brain amyloid, positron emission tomography (PET) may influence the diagnostic assessment and management of patients with cognitive impairment.


Objective
As part of a Japanese post-approval study to measure the safety of [18F]flutemetamol PET, the association of amyloid PET results with changes in diagnosis and diagnostic confidence was assessed.


Methods
Fifty-seven subjects were imaged for amyloid PET using [18F]flutemetamol at a single Japanese memory clinic. The cognitive diagnosis and referring physician's confidence in the diagnosis were recorded before and after availability of PET results. Imaging started approximately 90 minutes after [18F]flutemetamol administration with approximately 185 MBq injected. PET images were acquired for 30 minutes.


Results
Amyloid PET imaging led to change in diagnosis in 15/44 clinical subjects (34%). Mean diagnostic confidence increased by approximately 20%, from 73% pre-scan to 93% post-scan, and this rise was fairly consistent across the main patient subgroups (mild cognitive impairment, AD, and non-AD) irrespective of the pre-scan diagnosis and scan result.


Conclusion
The study examined the utility of amyloid PET imaging in a Japanese clinical cohort and highlighted the use of an etiological diagnosis in the presence of the amyloid scan. [18F]Flutemetamol PET led to a change in diagnosis in over 30% of cases and to an increase in diagnostic confidence by approximately 20% consistent with other reports.","Journal of Alzheimer's disease reports",32715277,[18F]Flutemetamol,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

To evaluate amyloid-β deposition with 18F-florbetaben (FBB) PET imaging against 11C-PIB PET in cognitive normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients.


Methods
We recruited 45 subjects (15 in each group of NC, MCI, and mild/moderate AD) who had undergone dynamic 18F-FBB amyloid PET imaging. For comparison study, 17 participants, including six NC, five MCI, and six AD patients, also underwent 11C-PIB PET imaging on separate days. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were calculated using the cerebellar cortex as the reference region with regions of interest (ROI) manually defined on co-registered CT. Quantitative analysis of mean cortical uptake was calculated using global SUVR. Spearman correlation analysis between MMSE scores and SUVR of 18F-FBB and 11C-PIB images were calculated.


Results
One (7%) of the 15 NC participants, nine (60%) of 15 MCI patients, and 12 (80%) of 15 AD patients had amyloid-positive lesions on 18F-FBB PET images. In AD patients, global SUVR was significantly higher than those of MCI patients (1.73 ± 0.62 vs. 1.55 ± 0.11, P < 0.001) and NC subjects (1.73 ± 0.62 vs. 1.13 ± 0.43, P < 0.001). In the comparison study, one NC participant, five MCI patients, and five AD patients had amyloid-positive lesions on 11C-PIB PET images. There was a significant linear correlation (r 2 = 0.81, P < 0.001) between 18F-FBB and PIB global SUVR values.

Functional involvement of hENT2 [18F]FLT transport was demonstrated in all cell lines. In vitro [18F]FLT uptake was higher in MDA-MB231 than in MCF7: 242 ± 9 vs. 147 ± 18% radioactivity/mg protein after 60 min under normoxia. Hypoxia showed no significant change in radiotracer uptake. Protein analysis revealed increased hENT1 (P < 0.0963) in MDA-MB231. Hypoxia did not change expression of either hENT1, hENT2, or TK1. In vitro inhibition experiments suggested involvement of hENT1, hENT2, and human concentrative nucleoside transporters during [18F]FLT uptake into all cell lines.

In this study, we compared the human biodistribution and dosimetry for 18F-FDG after oral and intravenous administrations sequentially in the same subjects to ascertain the dosimetry and potential suitability of orally administered 18F-FDG as an alternative to intravenous administration. We also compared our detailed intravenous 18F-FDG dosimetry with older dosimetry data. Methods: Nine healthy volunteers (6 male and 3 female; aged 19-32 y) underwent PET/CT imaging after oral and intravenous administration of 18F-FDG. Identical preparation and imaging protocols (except administration route) were used for oral and intravenous studies. During each imaging session, 9 whole-body PET scans were obtained at 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 120, and 240 min after 18F-FDG administration (370 ± 16 MBq). Source organ contours drawn using CT were overlaid onto registered PET images to extract time-activity curves. Time-integrated activity coefficients derived from time-activity curves were given as input to OLINDA/EXM for dose calculations. Results: Blood uptake after orally administered 18F-FDG peaked at 45-50 min after ingestion. The oral-to-intravenous ratios of 18F-FDG uptake for major organs at 45 min were 1.07 ± 0.24 for blood, 0.94 ± 0.39 for heart wall, 0.47 ± 0.12 for brain, 1.25 ± 0.18 for liver, and 0.84 ± 0.24 for kidneys. The highest organ-absorbed doses (μGy/MBq) after oral 18F-FDG administration were observed for urinary bladder (75.9 ± 17.2), stomach (48.4 ± 14.3), and brain (29.4 ± 5.1), and the effective dose was significantly higher (20%) than after intravenous administration (P = 0.002). Conclusion: 18F-FDG has excellent bioavailability after oral administration, but peak organ activities occur later than after intravenous injection. These data suggest PET at 2 h after oral 18F-FDG administration should yield images that are comparable in biodistribution to conventional clinical images acquired 1 h after injection.

31824,"[Relationship between CT Numbers and Artifacts Obtained Using CT-based Attenuation Correction of PET/CT].","PURPOSE
The aim of this study was to clarify the artifacts that occurred in the non-activity signal with computed tomography (CT)-based attenuation correction (CTAC) error due to image misregistration.


METHODS
We used a cylindrical phantom containing a test tube with a diameter of 15 mm as the non-activity signal part. Positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired for 30 minutes using the phantom with water in the non-activity signal part and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (18F-FDG) (5.3 kBq/ml) in the background area. CT scanning was performed by replacing the water with contrast agents at different dilutions to obtain arbitrary CT numbers (-1000 to 1000). The PET images were attenuation-corrected individually by the CT images in which the CT number of the non-activity signal part had changed. The relationship between the CT numbers and the CTAC artifact was determined by measuring the PET value in the non-activity signal part of the PET images and comparing Ci.


RESULTS
As the CT number of the CT images increased, Ci of the artifact increased. The CT number and Ci had a correlation of y=1.48x+2.86×103 (R2 =0.99) when CTAC was performed in units of CT numbers above 0 for PET data of water (0 HU) and a correlation of y=3.15x+6.26×103 (R2 =0.97) when CTAC was performed in units of CT numbers below 0 for PET data of air (-1000 HU). Although the original CT image was air, the artifacts due to CTAC errors with different Hounsfield units showed larger changes. In particular, positive artifacts were recognized in the PET images after CTAC depending on the Hounsfield units.


CONCLUSIONS
When the CT number was different from the original in CTAC, the PET value was different. CTAC should be performed with caution as there may be image misregistration.","Nihon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai zasshi",32963141,18F-FDG,y=3.15x+6.26×103,CT,"non-activity signal part",NULL

We aimed to characterize alterations of substrate utilization during epileptogenesis and in chronic epilepsy. The lithium-pilocarpine post status epilepticus (SE) rat model was used. We performed longitudinal O-(2-[(18)F]fluoroethyl)-l-tyrosine (18F-FET) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and calculated 18F-FET volume of distribution (Vt) and 18F-FDG uptake. Correlation analyses were performed with translocator protein-PET defined neuroinflammation from previously acquired data. We found reduced 18F-FET Vt at 48 h after SE (amygdala: -30.2%, p = 0.014), whereas 18F-FDG showed increased glucose uptake 4 and 24 h after SE (hippocampus: + 43.6% and +42.5%, respectively; p < 0.001) returning to baseline levels thereafter. In chronic epileptic animals, we found a reduction in 18F-FET and 18F-FDG in the hippocampus. No correlation was found for 18F-FET or 18F-FDG to microglial activation at seven days post SE. Whereas metabolic alterations do not reflect higher metabolism associated to activated microglia, they might be partially driven by chronic neuronal loss. However, both metabolisms diverge during early epileptogenesis, pointing to amino acid turnover as a possible biomarker and/or therapeutic target for epileptogenesis.","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism",30375913,18F-FDG,"18F-FET Vt",NULL,NULL,NULL

11053,"Increased Tumoral Microenvironmental pH Improves Cytotoxic Effect of Pharmacologic Ascorbic Acid in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Cells.","Background
The anticancer potential of pharmacologic ascorbic acid (AA) has been detected in a number of cancer cells. However, in vivo study suggested a strongly reduced cytotoxic activity of AA. It was known that pH could be a critical influencing factor for multiple anticancer treatments. In this study, we explored the influence of pH on the cytotoxicity of ascorbic acid. We employed castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cell lines PC3 and DU145 to observe the therapeutic effect of AA on PCa cells that were cultured with different pH in vitro. We also analyzed the influence of pH and extracellular oxidation on cytotoxicity of AA in cancer cells using reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, cellular uptake of AA, and NADPH assay. Male BALB/c nude mice bearing prostate carcinoma xenografts (PC3 or DU145) were used to assess treatment response to AA with or without bicarbonate in vivo. The cellular uptake of AA in PCa xenografts was detected using positron emission tomography (PET). Small animal PET/CT scans were performed on mice after the administration of 6-deoxy-6-[18F] fluoro-L-ascorbic acid (18F-DFA).


Results
Our in vitro studies demonstrate that acidic pH attenuates the cytotoxic activity of pharmacologic ascorbic acid by inhibiting AA uptake in PCa cells. Additionally, we found that the cancer cell-selective toxicity of AA depends on ROS. In vivo, combination of AA and bicarbonate could provide a significant better therapeutic outcome in comparison with controls or AA single treated mice. 18F-DFA PET imaging illustrated that the treatment with NaHCO3 could significantly increase the AA uptake in tumor.


Conclusions
The alkalinity of tumor microenvironment plays an important role in anticancer efficiency of AA in CRPC. 18F-DFA PET/CT imaging could predict the therapeutic response of PCa animal model through illustration of tumoral uptake of AA. 18F-DFA might be a potential PET tracer in clinical diagnosis and treatment for CRPC.","Frontiers in pharmacology",33071784,18F-DFA,"6-deoxy-6-[18F] fluoro-L-ascorbic acid",NULL,NULL,NULL

Second-generation tau radiotracers for use with positron emission tomography (PET) have been developed for visualization of tau deposits in vivo.

Therefore, we investigated the performance of early acquisitions of the novel tau-PET radiotracer [18F]PI-2620 as a potential substitute for [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG).


METHODS
Twenty-six subjects were referred with suspected tauopathies or overlapping parkinsonian syndromes (Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multi-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, multi-system atrophy, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia) and received a dynamic [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET (0-60 min p.i.) and static [18F]FDG-PET (30-50 min p.i.). Regional standardized uptake value ratios of early-phase images (single frame SUVr) and the blood flow estimate (R1) of [18F]PI-2620-PET were correlated with corresponding quantification of [18F]FDG-PET (global mean/cerebellar normalization). Reduced tracer uptake in cortical target regions was also interpreted visually using 3-dimensional stereotactic surface projections by three more and three less experienced readers. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between early-phase [18F]PI-2620 tau-PET and [18F]FDG-PET images for all cortical regions and frequencies of disagreement between images were compared for both more and less experienced readers.


RESULTS
Highest agreement with [18F]FDG-PET quantification was reached for [18F]PI-2620-PET acquisition from 0.5 to 2.5 min p.i. for global mean (lowest R = 0.69) and cerebellar scaling (lowest R = 0.63). Correlation coefficients (summed 0.5-2.5 min SUVr & R1) displayed strong agreement in all cortical target regions for global mean (RSUVr 0.76, RR1 = 0.77) and cerebellar normalization (RSUVr 0.68, RR1 = 0.68). Visual interpretation revealed high regional correlations between early-phase tau-PET and [18F]FDG-PET. There were no relevant differences between more and less experienced readers.

Early-phase imaging of [18F]PI-2620 can serve as a surrogate biomarker for neuronal injury. Dynamic imaging or a dual time-point protocol for tau-PET imaging could supersede additional [18F]FDG-PET imaging by indexing both the distribution of tau and the extent of neuronal injury.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32318783,[18F]FDG-PET,NULL,NULL,"cortical target regions",NULL

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder that leads to a loss of cognitive functioning, affecting older people as well as their families. An early detection of AD is therefore crucial to help people maintain mental function, and slow down or delay the symptoms of the disease. Studies have confirmed that the deposition of the amyloid-β peptide in the brain is a central event in AD pathology. A imaging probe for Aβmight provide a useful tool to be used in the diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy of AD.


METHODS
This article reports a new AD imaging probe [18F]FINH-Me, which has a high molar activity for Aβ. Automated synthesis of [18F]FINH-Me was performed in a single reactor using a two-step procedure; fluorination and hydrolysis. The qualities of this probe were tested and autoradiography was performed to determine if the probe was bound to the AD sections. And the micro-PET/CT imaging experiment was done to further confirm the combination of the probe and Aβ.


RESULTS
Optimized synthesis of [18F]FINH-Me was achieved in 90 minutes. The probe was then scaled up for large-batch production to generate 18.79-23.53 GBq of [18F]FINH-Me at EOS (n = 15) in high molar activity (79.9-122 GBq / μmol, at EOS, n = 15). In the AD brain sections, the radio activity was concentrated at the hippocampus and the temporal lobe area.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FINH-Me is a promising PET probe to be used in AD diagnose.","The quarterly journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging : official publication of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) [and] the International Association of Radiopharmacology (IAR), [and] Section of the Society of...",31140235,[18F]FINH-Me,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

[18F]fluoride was produced by the cyclotron and was incorporated into 4-[18F]fluorobenzamido-N-ethylmaleimide ([18F]FBEM), which was coupled next to the emulsions previously functionalized with a thiol group, via inclusion of either a thiol-PEG-lipid (SH-PEG12-C18), or a peptide-PEG-lipid (Cys-Pro-Ile-Glu-Asp-Arg-Pro-Met-Cys-PEG8-C18) derivative. Radiolabelled emulsions were obtained in a rapid and efficient fashion through facile-conjugated chemistry without the use of organic solvents, and characterized in terms of size, polydispersity, surface charge, pH, and osmolarity. PET imaging and biodistribution studies in BALB/c mice allowed obtaining the pharmacokinetics of the radiolabelled emulsions and determining the clearance pathways.

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are extensively studied and used as anti-cancer drugs, as single agents or in combination with other therapies. Most radiotracers developed to date have been chosen on the basis of strong PARP1-3 affinity. Herein, we propose to study AZD2461, a PARP inhibitor with lower affinity towards PARP3, and to investigate its potential for PARP targeting in vivo.


METHODS
Using the Cu-mediated 18F-fluorodeboronation of a carefully designed radiolabelling precursor, we accessed the 18F-labelled isotopologue of the PARP inhibitor AZD2461. Cell uptake of [18F]AZD2461 in vitro was assessed in a range of pancreatic cell lines (PSN-1, PANC-1, CFPAC-1 and AsPC-1) to assess PARP expression and in vivo in xenograft-bearing mice. Blocking experiments were performed with both olaparib and AZD2461.


RESULTS
[18F]AZD2461 was efficiently radiolabelled via both manual and automated procedures (9 % ± 3 % and 3 % ± 1 % activity yields non-decay corrected). [18F]AZD2461 was taken up in vivo in PARP1-expressing tumours, and the highest uptake was observed for PSN-1 cells (7.34 ± 1.16 %ID/g). In vitro blocking experiments showed a lesser ability of olaparib to reduce [18F]AZD2461 binding, indicating a difference in selectivity between olaparib and AZD2461.


CONCLUSION
Taken together, we show the importance of screening the PARP selectivity profile of radiolabelled PARP inhibitors for use as PET imaging agents.","Molecular imaging and biology",32342268,[18F]AZD2461,"18F-labelled isotopologue",PARP,NULL,AsPC-1
59630,"Assessment of radionuclide impurities in [18F]fluoromethylcholine ([18F]FMCH).","PURPOSE
[18F]Fluoromethylcholine ([18F]FMCH) is a radiopharmaceutical used in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for the study of prostate, breast, and brain tumors. It is usually synthesized in cyclotron facilities where 18F is produced by proton irradiation of [18O]H2O through 18O(p,n)18F reaction. Due to the activation of target materials, the bombardment causes unwanted radionuclidic impurities in [18O]H2O, that need to be removed during the radiopharmaceutical synthesis. Thus, the aim of this study is to quantify the radionuclide impurities in the 18F production process and in the synthesized [18F]FMCH, demonstrating the radionuclidic purity of this radiopharmaceutical.


METHODS
Long-lived radionuclide impurities were experimentally assessed using high-resolution gamma and liquid scintillation spectrometries, while short-lived impurities were monitored analyzing the decay curve of the irradiated [18O]H2O with an activity calibrator. As spectrometric radionuclide library, a Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation of the 18F-target assembly was previously performed.


RESULTS
3H, 52,54Mn, 56,57,58Co, 95m,96Tc, 109Cd, and 184Re were found in the irradiated [18O]H2O, but no radionuclide was found in the non-irradiated [18O]H2O neither in the final [18F]FMCH solution with an activity concentration greater than the minimum detectable activity concentration. A total impurity activity <6.2 kBq was measured in the irradiated [18O]H2O, whereas a [18F]FMCH radionuclide purity >99.9999998% was estimated. Finally, the decay curve of the irradiated [18O]H2O revealed a very low maximum of 13N activity (<0.03% of 18F) even immediately after the end of bombardment.

Targeting glucose metabolism in cancer cells remains attractive for cancer treatment. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) meditate the first and rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated the key mediator of glucose transporters and evaluated its therapeutic value in a preclinical model of CRPC. 18F-FDG PET showed a higher SUVmax in CRPC than in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer, and GLUT1 expression positively correlated with SUVmax and was associated with a worse CRPC outcome. GLUT1 inhibition significantly suppressed cell growth, glycolysis and tumor volume in a xenograft model both in CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that androgen receptor (AR) directly bound to the GLUT1 gene promoter to promote GLUT1 transcription. Combining GLUT1 inhibition and enzalutamide remarkably suppressed proliferation and glycolysis and induced apoptosis in CRPC cells.

Mean 18F-FDG uptake and mean 18F-AV-45 standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) in regions of hypometabolism and elevated amyloid load typical for AD, respectively, were employed as volume of interest (VOI)-based PET measures. The diagnostic performance for identifying none-to-low vs. intermediate-to-high AD neuropathological change (ADNC) was assessed for all biomarkers. Results We observed significant associations between PES of FDG-ADCRP and Braak stage (ρ>0.48, P<0.005) and between PES of Aβ-ADCRP and Thal phase (ρ>0.66, P<0.001). PES of FDG-ADCRP, PES of Aβ-ADCRP, and their combination identified intermediate-to-high ADNC with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.80, 0.95, and 0.98 (n = 22), respectively. Mean 18F-FDG uptake and mean 18F-AV-45 SUVr in AD-typical regions were also significantly associated with Braak stage (|ρ|>0.45, P<0.01) and Thal phase (ρ>0.55, P<0.01), respectively.

Contemplating all subjects with available 18F-FDG PET/neuropathology information (n = 38), PES of FDG-ADCRP was a significant predictor of intermediate-to-high ADNC (AUC=0.72), while mean 18F-FDG uptake was not (AUC=0.66), albeit the difference between methods was not significant. Conclusion PES of FDG-ADCRP, a measure of neurodegeneration, shows close correspondence with the extent of tau pathology, as assessed by Braak tangle stage.

26869,"The Role of PET/CT in the Era of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: State of Art.","BACKGROUND
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have achieved astonishing results and improved overall survival (OS) in several types of malignancies, including advanced melanoma. However, due to a peculiar type of anti-cancer activity provided by these drugs, the response patterns during ICI treatment are completely different from that with "old" chemotherapeutic agents.


OBJECTIVE
To provide an overview of the available literature and potentials of 18F-FDG PET/CT in advanced melanoma during the course of therapy with ICI in the context of treatment response evaluation.


METHOD
Morphologic criteria, expressed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), immune-related response criteria (irRC), irRECIST, and, more recently, immune-RECIST (iRECIST), along with response criteria based on the metabolic parameters with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18FFDG), have been explored.


RESULTS
To overcome the limits of traditional response criteria, new metabolic response criteria have been introduced on time and are being continuously updated, such as the PET/CT Criteria for the early prediction of Response to Immune checkpoint inhibitor Therapy (PECRIT), the PET Response Evaluation Criteria for Immunotherapy (PERCIMT), and "immunotherapy-modified" PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (imPERCIST). The introduction of new PET radiotracers, based on monoclonal antibodies combined with radioactive elements ("immune-PET"), are of great interest.


CONCLUSION
Although the role of 18F-FDG PET/CT in malignant melanoma has been widely validated for detecting distant metastases and recurrences, evidences in course of ICI are still scarce and larger multicenter clinical trials are needed.","Current radiopharmaceuticals",31749440,18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose,"18F-FDG PET/CT","monoclonal antibodies",NULL,NULL
29871,"Sapap3 deletion causes dynamic synaptic density abnormalities: a longitudinal [11C]UCB-J PET study in a model of obsessive-compulsive disorder-like behaviour.","BACKGROUND
Currently, the evidence on synaptic abnormalities in neuropsychiatric disorders-including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)-is emerging. The newly established positron emission tomography (PET) ligand ((R)-1-((3-((11)C-methyl-(11)C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one) ([11C]UCB-J) provides the opportunity to visualize synaptic density changes in vivo, by targeting the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). Here, we aim to evaluate such alterations in the brain of the SAP90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (Sapap3) knockout (ko) mouse model, showing an abnormal corticostriatal neurotransmission resulting in OCD-like behaviour.


METHODS
Longitudinal [11C]UCB-J µPET/CT scans were acquired in Sapap3 ko and wildtype (wt) control mice (n = 9/group) to study SV2A availability. Based on the Logan reference method, we calculated the volume of distribution (VT(IDIF)) for [11C]UCB-J. Both cross-sectional (wt vs. ko) and longitudinal (3 vs. 9 months) volume-of-interest-based statistical analysis and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping were performed. Both [11C]UCB-J ex vivo autoradiography and [3H]UCB-J in vitro autoradiography were used for the validation of the µPET data.


RESULTS
At the age of 3 months, Sapap3 ko mice are already characterized by a significantly lower SV2A availability compared to wt littermates (i.a. cortex - 12.69%, p < 0.01; striatum - 14.12%, p < 0.001, thalamus - 13.11%, p < 0.001, and hippocampus - 12.99%, p < 0.001). Healthy ageing in control mice was associated with a diffuse and significant (p < 0.001) decline throughout the brain, whereas in Sapap3 ko mice this decline was more confined to the corticostriatal level. A strong linear relationship (p < 0.0001) was established between the outcome parameters of [11C]UCB-J µPET and [11C]UCB-J ex vivo autoradiography, while such relationship was absent for [3H]UCB-J in vitro autoradiography.


CONCLUSIONS
[11C]UCB-J PET is a potential marker for synaptic density deficits in the Sapap3 ko mouse model for OCD, parallel to disease progression. Our data suggest that [11C]UCB-J ex vivo autoradiography is a suitable proxy for [11C]UCB-J PET data in mice.","EJNMMI research",33185747,[11C]UCB-J,"[11C]UCB-J PET data",SV2A,NULL,NULL

Material and Methods: A prospective pilot study in seven patients with HCC with 41 liver lesions: 37 suspected malignant lesions (tumor lesions) and 4 regenerative nodules. For each liver lesion, uptake of 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG uptake were measured [standard uptake value (SUV) and lesion-to-liver background ratios (TBR-SUV)], and correlated with dynamic characteristics (HU and TBR-HU) obtained on contrast enhanced CT data. Immunohistochemistry staining of PSMA in the tumor tissue was analyzed in samples obtained from 5 patients with HCC and compared to control samples from 3 patients with prostate cancer. Results: Thirty-six of the 37 tumor lesions and none of the regenerative nodules showed increased 68Ga-PSMA uptake while only 10 lesions were 18F-FDG avid. Based on contrast enhancement, tumor lesions were categorized into 27 homogeneously enhancing lesions, nine lesions with "mosaic" enhancement composed of enhancing and non-enhancing regions in the same lesion and a single non-enhancing lesion, the latter being the only non-68Ga-PSMA avid lesion. Using the Mann-Whitney test, 68Ga-PSMA uptake was found significantly higher in enhancing tumor areas compared to non-enhancing areas and in contrast, 18F-FDG uptake was higher in non-enhancing areas, P<0.001 for both. 68Ga-PSMA uptake (TBR SUVmax) was found to correlate with vascularity (TBR-HU) (Spearman r=0.866, p<0.001). Immunohistochemistry showed intense intra-tumoral microvessel staining for PSMA in HCC, in contrast with cytoplasmic and membranous staining, mainly in the luminal border, in prostate cancer samples. In two of the study patients 68Ga-PSMA PET-CT identified unexpected extrahepatic metastases. Four regenerative liver nodules showed no increased uptake of either of the PET tracers.

In 28 patients (15M, 13F, mean age: 52.6 ± 17.6) that TgDT could be calculated, 18F-FDG PET/CT was positive in 12 patients. Median TgDT was lower in 18F-FDG PET/CT positive patients compared to the negative cases (p < 0.05). Patients with skeletal metastasis or local recurrence had a shorter DT compared to the patients with lung metastasis. TgDT was correlated with peak standardized uptake value (SUVpeak) (p < 0.05).

We aimed to investigate nutrient fluxes associated with MCT1 inhibition by AZD3965 to identify possible biomarkers of drug action. We synthesized an 18F-labeled lactate analogue, [18F]-S-fluorolactate ([18F]-S-FL), that was used alongside [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), and 13C-labeled glucose and lactate, to investigate the modulation of metabolism with AZD3965 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma models in NOD/SCID mice. Comparative analysis of glucose and lactate-based probes showed a preference for glycolytic metabolism in vitro, whereas in vivo, both glucose and lactate were used as metabolic fuel. While intratumoral L-[1-13C]lactate and [18F]-S-FL were unchanged or lower at early (5 or 30 min) timepoints, these variables were higher compared to vehicle controls at 4 h following treatment with AZD3965, which indicates that inhibition of MCT1-mediated lactate import is reversed over time. Nonetheless, AZD3965 treatment impaired DLBCL tumor growth in mice. This was hypothesized to be a consequence of metabolic strain, as AZD3965 treatment showed a reduction in glycolytic intermediates and inhibition of the TCA cycle likely due to downregulated PDH activity.

16950,"Comparison of Image Quality and Semi-quantitative Measurements with Digital PET/CT and Standard PET/CT from Different Vendors.","Purpose
This study aimed to evaluate the concordance and equivalence of results between the newly acquired digital PET/CT(dPET) and the standard PET/CT (sPET) to investigate possible differences in visual and semi-quantitative analyses.


Methods
A total of 30 participants were enrolled and underwent a single 18F-FDG injection followed by dual PET/CT scans, by a dPET scan, and immediately after by the sPET scan or vice versa. Two readers reviewed overall image quality using a 5-point scale and counted the number of suggestive 18F-FDG avid lesions. The SUV values were measured in the background organs and in hypermetabolic target lesions. Additionally, we objectively evaluated image quality using the liver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).


Results
The dPET identified 4 additional 18F-FDG avid lesions in 3 of 30 participants with improved visual image quality. The standard deviations of SUV of the background organs were significantly lower with DigitalPET than with sPET, and dPET could acquire images with better SNR (11.13 ± 2.01 vs. 8.71 ± 1.32, P < 0.001). The reliability of SUV values between scanners showed excellent agreement. Bland-Altman plot analysis of 81 lesions showed an acceptable agreement between scanners for most of the SUVmax and SUVpeak values. No relationship between the SUV values and time delays of dual PET/CT acquisition was found.


Conclusions
The dPET provides improved image quality and lesion detectability than the sPET. The semi-quantitative values of the two PET/CT systems of different vendors are comparable. This pilot study will be an important basis for possible interchangeable use of either system in clinical practice.","Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",33088352,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG avid lesions",SUVpeak,dPET,NULL

25257,"18F-fluoride PET/MR in cardiac amyloid: A comparison study with aortic stenosis and age- and sex-matched controls.","OBJECTIVES
Cardiac MR is widely used to diagnose cardiac amyloid, but cannot differentiate AL and ATTR subtypes: an important distinction given their differing treatments and prognoses. We used PET/MR imaging to quantify myocardial uptake of 18F-fluoride in ATTR and AL amyloid patients, as well as participants with aortic stenosis and age/sex-matched controls.


METHODS
In this prospective multicenter study, patients were recruited in Edinburgh and New York and underwent 18F-fluoride PET/MR imaging. Standardized volumes of interest were drawn in the septum and areas of late gadolinium enhancement to derive myocardial standardized uptake values (SUV) and tissue-to-background ratio (TBRMEAN) after correction for blood pool activity in the right atrium.


RESULTS
53 patients were scanned: 18 with cardiac amyloid (10 ATTR and 8 AL), 13 controls, and 22 with aortic stenosis. No differences in myocardial TBR values were observed between participants scanned in Edinburgh and New York. Mean myocardial TBRMEAN values in ATTR amyloid (1.13 ± 0.16) were higher than controls (0.84 ± 0.11, P = .0006), aortic stenosis (0.73 ± 0.12, P < .0001), and those with AL amyloid (0.96 ± 0.08, P = .01). TBRMEAN values within areas of late gadolinium enhancement provided discrimination between patients with ATTR (1.36 ± 0.23) and all other groups (e.g., AL [1.06 ± 0.07, P = .003]). A TBRMEAN threshold >1.14 in areas of LGE demonstrated 100% sensitivity (CI 72.25 to 100%) and 100% specificity (CI 67.56 to 100%) for ATTR compared to AL amyloid (AUC 1, P = .0004).


CONCLUSION
Quantitative 18F-fluoride PET/MR imaging can distinguish ATTR amyloid from other similar phenotypes and holds promise in improving the diagnosis of this condition.","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology",33000405,18F-fluoride,"18F-fluoride PET/MR","ATTR amyloid",NULL,NULL

Subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with available baseline 18F-florbetapir and T1-MRI scans were included. The cross-sectional cohort consisted of 181 controls and 148 AD subjects. The longitudinal cohort consisted of 431 SMC/MCI subjects, 85 of whom converted to AD during follow-up. PET images were normalized to MNI space and post-processed using in-house software. Relative retention indices (SUVr) were computed with respect to pontine, cerebellar, and composite reference regions. Several textural and shape features were extracted then combined using a support vector machine (SVM) to build a predictive model of AD conversion. Diagnostic and prognostic performance was evaluated using ROC analysis and survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model. The three SUVr and all the tested features effectively discriminated AD subjects in cross-sectional analysis (all p < 0.001). In longitudinal analysis, the variables with the highest prognostic value were composite SUVr (AUC 0.86; accuracy 81%), skewness (0.87; 83%), local minima (0.85; 79%), Geary's index (0.86; 81%), gradient norm maximal argument (0.83; 82%), and the SVM model (0.91; 86%). The adjusted hazard ratio for AD conversion was 5.5 for the SVM model, compared with 4.0, 2.6, and 3.8 for cerebellar, pontine and composite SUVr (all p < 0.001), indicating that appropriate amyloid textural and shape features predict conversion to AD with at least as good accuracy as classical SUVr.","Brain imaging and behavior",29427064,18F-florbetapir,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Abnormal activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKt/mTOR) pathway has been found to be involved in breast cancer proliferation. Pictilisib (GDC-0941) is a potent inhibitor of PI3K with high affinity and is undergoing phase 2 clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to develop a noninvasive PI3K radiotracer to help determine the mechanism of the PI3K/AKt/mTOR pathway to aid in diagnosis. We designed a new 18F-radiolabeled radiotracer based on the structure of pictilisib, to evaluate noninvasively abnormal activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. To increase the water solubility, and to decrease hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal uptake of the tracer, pictilisib was modified with triethylene glycol di(p-toluenesulfonate) (TsO-PEG3-OTs) to obtain TsO-PEG3-GDC-0941 as the precursor for 18F labeling. A nonradiolabeled reference compound [19F]-PEG3-GDC-0941 was also prepared. Breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, were used as high- and low-expression PI3K models, respectively. PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution assays of [18F]-PEG3-GDC-0941 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 xenografts were also performed, and the results were compared. The precursor compound and reference standard compound were successfully synthesized and identified using NMR and mass spectroscopy. The 18F radiolabeling was achieved with a high yield (61 ± 1%) at a high molar activity (2100 ± 100 MBq/mg). MicroPET images and biodistribution studies showed a higher uptake of the radiotracer in MCF-7 tumors than in MDA-MB-231 tumors (7.56 ± 1.01%ID/g vs 4.07 ± 0.68%ID/g, 1 h postinjection). Additionally, the MCF-7 tumor uptake was significantly decreased when a blocking dose of GDC-0941 was coinjected, indicating high specificity. The liver was found to be the major excretory organ with 5.82 ± 0.88%ID/g at 30 min postinjection for MCF-7 mice.

In order to better understand the concept of mechanical dyssynchrony, a promising hallmark of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) response, we investigated its effect on regional myocardial metabolism and myocardial blood flow (MBF) in non-ischemic CRT candidates.


RESULTS
Thirty consecutive non-ischemic CRT eligible patients underwent static 18F-FDG and resting dynamic 13N-NH3 PET/CT. 18F-FDG uptake and MBF for septal and lateral wall were analysed and septal-to-lateral wall ratios (SLR) were calculated. Based on the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony (septal flash and/or apical rocking) on echocardiography, patients were divided into 2 groups, with (n = 23) and without (n = 7) mechanical dyssynchrony. Patients with mechanical dyssynchrony had significantly lower 18F-FDG SUVmean in the septum compared with the lateral wall (5.58 ± 2.65 vs 11.19 ± 4.10, p < 0.0001), while patients without mechanical dyssynchrony had a more homogeneous 18F-FDG distribution (7.33 ± 2.88 vs 8.31 ± 2.50, respectively, p = 0.30). Similarly, MBF was significantly different between the septal and lateral wall in the dyssynchrony group (0.57 ± 0.11 ml/g/min vs 0.92 ± 0.23 ml/g/min, respectively, p < 0.0001), whereas no difference was observed in the non-dyssynchrony group (0.61 ± 0.23 ml/g/min vs 0.77 ± 0.21 ml/g/min, respectively, p = 0.16). 18F-FDG SLR, but not MBF SLR, was associated with the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony and showed a significant inverse correlation with volumetric reverse remodeling after CRT (r = - 0.62, p = 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Non-ischemic heart failure patients with mechanical dyssynchrony demonstrate heterogeneous regional metabolism and MBF compared with patients without dyssynchrony. However, only 18F-FDG SLR appeared to be highly associated with the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony.

The objective of this study was to develop a novel 68Ga-labeled TMVP1 for VEGFR-3 PET imaging and to investigate its safety, biodistribution, and tumor-localizing efficacy in xenograft tumor models and a small cohort of patients with recurrent ovarian and cervical cancer.


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
The DOTA-conjugated TMVP1 peptide was labeled with radionuclide 68Ga. SPR and saturation binding assays were used for the receptor-binding studies. Gynecologic xenograft tumors were employed for small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-TMVP1 in vivo. In the clinical study, 5 healthy volunteers and 8 patients with gynecologic cancer underwent whole-body PET/CT after being injected with 68Ga-DOTA-TMVP1.


RESULTS
DOTA-TMVP1 was successfully labeled with 68Ga. LECs showed higher binding capacity with 68Ga-DOTA-TMVP1 than LEC(shVEGFR-3) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In mice with subcutaneous C33-A and SKOV-3 xenografts, the tracer was rapidly eliminated through the kidney to the bladder, and the small-animal PET/CT helped to clearly visualize the tumors. In patients with recurrent ovarian cancer and cervical cancer, tracer accumulation well above the background level was demonstrated in most identified sites of disease; especially with recurrent endodermal sinus tumors, the diagnostic value of 68Ga-DOTA-TMVP1 was comparable with that of 18F-FDG PET/CT.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We searched for English-language studies, published through May 2019, on the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and PET/MRI for gynecological malignancies. To reduce inter-study heterogeneity, we focused primarily on studies in which both PET/CT and PET/MRI were performed on the entire study cohort. We pooled the sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve values for PET/CT and PET/MRI and determined the 95% confidence intervals (CIs).


RESULTS
Out of 30 studies, nine met the inclusion criteria. On patient-based analysis, PET/CT had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 62.6% (95% CI: 47.1%-76%) and 91.6% (95% CI: 81.9%-96.3%), respectively, compared with 73.3% (95% CI: 63.1%-81.6%) (P = 0.22) and 91.2% (95% CI: 81.8%-96%) (P = 94) for PET/MRI. On lesion-based analysis, PET/CT had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 81.5% (95% CI: 59.3%-93.1%) and 86.6% (95% CI: 77.3%-92.5%), respectively, compared with 84.7% (95% CI: 66.8%-93.8%) (P = 0.77) and 89.3% (95% CI: 85.2%-92.3%) (P = 0.51) for PET/MRI. The diagnostic odds ratios for PET/CT compared with PET/MRI were not significantly different in the patient-based (P = 0.48) and lesion-based analyses (P = 0.4).


CONCLUSION
Compared with PET/CT, PET/MRI had slightly better diagnostic performance to that of 18F-FDG PET/CT in the gynecological malignancies on lesion level (44 vs 26) and patient level analysis (28 vs 17).

The clinical implications of the metabolic parameters of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutated lung cancer are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic utility of the parameters in EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients.


Patients and Methods
We retrospectively enrolled 134 patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (72 EGFR-negative and 62 EGFR-positive). We evaluated the correlation between EGFR mutational status and the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), as well as the associations between treatment outcomes in EGFR-mutated patients and various metabolic parameters of primary tumors. For the best predictive parameters, we calculated the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) using two SUV cutoffs: 1.5 (MTV1.5, TLG1.5) and 2.5 (MTV2.5, TLG2.5).


Results
Mean SUVmax was lower for EGFR-mutated tumors compared with EGFR wild-type (6.11 vs 10.41, p < 0.001) tumors. Low SUVmax was significantly associated with positive EGFR mutation (odds ratio = 1.74). Multivariate analysis for survival demonstrated that high MTV1.5, TLG1.5, MTV2.5, and TLG2.5 were independently associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and the highest hazard ratios were found in TLG1.5 (3.26 for PFS and 4.62 for OS).

Sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) is a highly sensitive tracer of bone reconstruction, evolving as an important imaging agent for the assessment of malignant bone diseases. We attempted to investigate for the first time the prognostic significance of 18F-NaF PET/CT in newly diagnosed, symptomatic MM patients planned for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Forty-seven patients underwent dynamic and static PET/CT with 18F-NaF before treatment. After correlation with the respective findings on CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT that served as reference, the 18F-NaF PET findings were compared with established factors of high-risk disease, like cytogenetic abnormalities as well as bone marrow plasma cell infiltration rate. Furthermore, the impact of 18F-NaF PET/CT on progression-free survival (PFS) was analyzed. Correlation analysis revealed a moderate, significant correlation of the 18F-NaF parameters SUVaverage and K1 in reference tissue with bone marrow plasma cell infiltration rate. However, no significant correlation was observed regarding all other 18F-NaF PET parameters. Survival analysis revealed that patients with a pathologic 18F-NaF PET/CT have a shorter PFS (median = 36.2 months) than those with a physiologic scan (median = 55.6 months) (p = 0.02). Nevertheless, no quantitative 18F-NaF parameter could be shown to adversely affect PFS. In contrast, the respective analysis for quantitative dynamic 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed that the parameters SUVmax, fractional blood volume (VB), k3 and influx from reference tissue as well as SUVaverage from MM lesions had a significant negative impact on patient survival.

32829,"The value of Bayesian penalized likelihood reconstruction for improving lesion conspicuity of malignant lung tumors on 18F-FDG PET/CT: comparison with ordered subset expectation maximization reconstruction incorporating time-of-flight model and point spread function correction.","OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the value of Bayesian penalized likelihood (BPL) reconstruction for improving lesion conspicuity of malignant lung tumors on 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET/CT) as compared with the ordered subset expectation maximization (OSEM) reconstruction incorporating time-of-flight (TOF) model and point-spread-function (PSF) correction.


METHODS
Twenty-nine patients with primary or metastatic lung cancers who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT were retrospectively studied. PET images were reconstructed with OSEM + TOF, OSEM + TOF + PSF, and BPL with noise penalty strength β-value of 200, 400, 600, and 800. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was determined in normal liver parenchyma. Lung lesion conspicuity was evaluated in 50 lung lesions by using a 4-point scale (0, no visible; 1, poor; 2, good; 3, excellent conspicuity). Two observers were independently asked to choose the most preferred reconstruction for detecting the lung lesions on a per-patient level. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured in each of the 50 lung lesions.


RESULTS
Liver SNR on the images reconstructed by BPL with β-value of 600 and 800 (17.8 ± 3.7 and 22.5 ± 4.6, respectively) was significantly higher than that by OSEM + TOF + PSF (15.0 ± 3.4, p < 0.0001). BPL with β-value of 600 was chosen most frequently as the preferred reconstruction algorithm for lung lesion assessment by both observers. The conspicuity score of the lung lesions < 10 mm in diameter on images reconstructed by BPL with β-value of 600 was significantly greater than that with OSEM + TOF + PSF (2.2 ± 0.8 vs 1.6 ± 0.9, p < 0.0001), while the conspicuity score of the lesions ≥ 10 mm in diameter was not significantly different between BPL with β-value of 600 and OSEM + TOF + PSF. The mean SUVmax was increased by BPL with β-value of 600 for the lung lesions with < 10 mm in diameter, compared to OSEM + TOF + PSF (3.4 ± 3.1 to 4.2 ± 3.5, p = 0.001).

38962,"Development of [18F]FAMTO: A novel fluorine-18 labelled positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging CYP11B1 and CYP11B2 enzymes in adrenal glands.","INTRODUCTION
Primary aldosteronism accounts for 6-15% of hypertension cases, the single biggest contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Whilst ~50% of these patients have unilateral aldosterone-producing adenomas, only a minority of these have curative surgery as the current diagnosis of unilateral disease is poor. Carbon-11 radiolabelled metomidate ([11C]MTO) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer able to selectively identify CYP11B1/2 expressing adrenocortical lesions of the adrenal gland. However, the use of [11C]MTO is limited to PET centres equipped with on-site cyclotrons due to its short half-life of 20.4 min. Radiolabelling a fluorometomidate derivative with fluorine-18 (radioactive half life 109.8 min) in the para-aromatic position ([18F]FAMTO) has the potential to overcome this disadvantage and allow it to be transported to non-cyclotron-based imaging centres.


METHODS
Two strategies for the one-step radio-synthesis of [18F]FAMTO were developed. [18F]FAMTO was obtained via radiofluorination via use of sulfonium salt (1) and boronic ester (2) precursors. [18F]FAMTO was evaluated in vitro by autoradiography of pig adrenal tissues and in vivo by determining its biodistribution in rodents. Rat plasma and urine were analysed to determine [18F]FAMTO metabolites.


RESULTS
[18F]FAMTO is obtained from sulfonium salt (1) and boronic ester (2) precursors in 7% and 32% non-isolated radiochemical yield (RCY), respectively. Formulated [18F]FAMTO was obtained with >99% radiochemical and enantiomeric purity with a synthesis time of 140 min from the trapping of [18F]fluoride ion on an anion-exchange resin (QMA cartridge). In vitro autoradiography of [18F]FAMTO demonstrated exquisite specific binding in CYP11B-rich pig adrenal glands. In vivo [18F]FAMTO rapidly accumulates in adrenal glands. Liver uptake was about 34% of that in the adrenals and all other organs were <12% of the adrenal uptake at 60 min post-injection. Metabolite analysis showed 13% unchanged [18F]FAMTO in blood at 10 min post-administration and rapid urinary excretion. In vitro assays in human blood showed a free fraction of 37.5%.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FAMTO, a new 18F-labelled analogue of metomidate, was successfully synthesised. In vitro and in vivo characterization demonstrated high selectivity towards aldosterone-producing enzymes (CYP11B1 and CYP11B2), supporting the potential of this radiotracer for human investigation.","Nuclear medicine and biology",30578137,[18F]FAMTO,"18F-labelled analogue",CYP11B2,NULL,NULL
41895,"Hypoxia-induced modulation of glucose transporter expression impacts 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma.","PURPOSE
To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the variable standard uptake value (SUV) of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET-CT) imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and whether hypoxia-induced glucose transporter expression contributes to the progression of HCC and the rate of glycolysis in HCC cells.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sixteen HCC specimens obtained from patients who underwent pre-treatment staging with 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging were divided into high maximum SUV (SUVmax > 8) and low SUVmax (SUVmax < 5) groups and employed for whole-genome gene expression profiling using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The relationship between SUVmax and the expression of glucose transporters 1 and 3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3) was further validated using immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in different HCC cells under hypoxia and normoxia conditions were monitored by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Glycolysis and FDG uptake by HCC cells were measured using the Seahorse XF glycolysis stress test and 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging. The effect of GLUT1 and GLUT3 on glucose uptake in HCC cells was examined using the fluorescent D-glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG) followed by detection of fluorescence produced by the cells using flow cytometry.


RESULTS
Glucose transporters are differentially expressed between samples from HCC patients with high and low SUVmax. In particular, over-expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in high SUVmax patients was correlated with high glucose uptake and overall survival. The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was significantly induced by hypoxia in different HCC cells. High expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in HCC cells were correlated with high rates of glycolysis and 18F-FDG uptake. Therefore, our data suggested that hypoxia-induced glucose transporters expression could result in the variations of 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging and progression of HCC, contributing to more aggressive disease phenotypes like large tumor size, recurrence, and poor survival.


CONCLUSION
Over-expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 significantly increase glucose uptake in HCC cells. Hypoxia-induced glucose transporters expression may therefore be a contributing variable in 18F-FDG PET-CT imaging and progression in HCC.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31832727,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET-CT",GLUT3,NULL,NULL

The feasibility of using N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)-5-methylbenzamide (18F-ISO-1) to image solid tumors in lymphoma, breast cancer, and head and neck cancer has been previously established. Here, we report the results of the first dedicated clinical trial of 18F-ISO-1 in women with primary breast cancer. Our study objective was to determine whether 18F-ISO-1 PET could provide an in vivo measure of tumor proliferative status, and we hypothesized that uptake would correlate with a tissue-based assay of proliferation, namely Ki-67 expression. Methods: Twenty-eight women with 29 primary invasive breast cancers were prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT02284919) between March 2015 and January 2017. Each received an injection of 278-527 MBq of 18F-ISO-1 and then underwent PET/CT imaging of the breasts 50-55 min later. In vivo uptake of 18F-ISO-1 was quantitated by SUVmax and distribution volume ratios and was compared with ex vivo immunohistochemistry for Ki-67. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests assessed uptake differences across Ki-67 thresholds, and Spearman correlation tested associations between uptake and Ki-67. Results: Tumor SUVmax (median, 2.0 g/mL; range, 1.3-3.3 g/mL), partial-volume-corrected SUVmax, and SUV ratios were tested against Ki-67. Tumors stratified into the high-Ki-67 (≥20%) group had SUVmax greater than the low-Ki-67 (<20%) group (P = 0.02). SUVmax exhibited a positive correlation with Ki-67 across all breast cancer subtypes (ρ = 0.46, P = 0.01, n = 29). Partial-volume-corrected SUVmax was positively correlated with Ki-67 for invasive ductal carcinoma (ρ = 0.51, P = 0.02, n = 21).

The CT attenuation units (Hounsfield units) correlated with the prostate primary in the case of direct tumor extension from the prostate, whereas in hematogenous metastatic seeding the Hounsfield units were lower than in the primary prostatic tumor. A favorable outcome to 177Lu-PSMA-617 PRLT was observed in patients with low or no baseline 18F-FDG uptake despite a high Gleason score and a high-risk National Comprehensive Cancer Network prognostic category and did not correlate with the latter alone, whereas a high SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET/CT was associated with an adverse outcome. These findings suggest a promising role for 18F-FDG PET/CT in predicting therapeutic outcomes more confidently, and hence the concept of dual-tracer PET appears to hold good in prostate adenocarcinoma theranostics.","Journal of nuclear medicine technology",32111660,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",CT,NULL,NULL

With the development of more advanced positron emission tomography (PET) technology, more radiotracers targeting NET have been reported, with superior temporal and spatial resolutions, along with the possibility of functional and kinetic analysis.

Methods: The study included 102 patients with biochemically recurrent PC after radical prostatectomy undergoing 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT imaging. On the basis of various clinical variables, patients with corresponding 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans were matched. All PET/CT scans (n = 204) were reviewed by 1 nuclear medicine physician. First, all PET-positive lesions were noted. Then, lesions suspected of being recurrent PC were differentiated from lesions attributed to a benign origin on the basis of known pitfalls and information from CT. For each region, the SUVmax of the lesion with the highest PSMA-ligand uptake was noted. Detection rates were determined, and SUVmax was compared separately for 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 18F-PSMA-1007. Results: In total, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed 369 and 178 PSMA-ligand-positive lesions, respectively. 18F-PSMA-1007 PET revealed approximately 5 times more lesions attributed to a benign origin than did 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (245 vs. 52 lesions, respectively). The benign lesions most frequently observed were ganglia, unspecific lymph node, and bone lesions, at a rate of 43%, 31%, and 24% for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET and 29%, 42%, and 27% for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET, respectively. The SUVmax of lesions attributed to a benign origin was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET.

12936,"Cerebrospinal fluid profile of NPTX2 supports role of Alzheimer's disease-related inhibitory circuit dysfunction in adults with Down syndrome.","BACKGROUND
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the major cause of death in adults with Down syndrome (DS). There is an urgent need for objective markers of AD in the DS population to improve early diagnosis and monitor disease progression. NPTX2 has recently emerged as a promising cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker of Alzheimer-related inhibitory circuit dysfunction in sporadic AD patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate NPTX2 in the CSF of adults with DS and to explore the relationship of NPTX2 to CSF levels of the PV interneuron receptor, GluA4, and existing AD biomarkers (CSF and neuroimaging).


METHODS
This is a cross-sectional, retrospective study of adults with DS with asymptomatic AD (aDS, n = 49), prodromal AD (pDS, n = 18) and AD dementia (dDS, n = 27). Non-trisomic controls (n = 34) and patients with sporadic AD dementia (sAD, n = 40) were included for comparison. We compared group differences in CSF NPTX2 according to clinical diagnosis and degree of intellectual disability. We determined the relationship of CSF NPTX2 levels to age, cognitive performance (CAMCOG, free and cued selective reminding, semantic verbal fluency), CSF levels of a PV-interneuron marker (GluA4) and core AD biomarkers; CSF Aβ1-42, CSF t-tau, cortical atrophy (magnetic resonance imaging) and glucose metabolism ([18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography).


RESULTS
Compared to controls, mean CSF NPTX2 levels were lower in DS at all AD stages; aDS (0.6-fold, adj.p < 0.0001), pDS (0.5-fold, adj.p < 0.0001) and dDS (0.3-fold, adj.p < 0.0001). This reduction was similar to that observed in sporadic AD (0.5-fold, adj.p < 0.0001). CSF NPTX2 levels were not associated with age (p = 0.6), intellectual disability (p = 0.7) or cognitive performance (all p > 0.07). Low CSF NPTX2 levels were associated with low GluA4 in all clinical groups; controls (r2 = 0.2, p = 0.003), adults with DS (r2 = 0.4, p < 0.0001) and sporadic AD (r2 = 0.4, p < 0.0001). In adults with DS, low CSF NPTX2 levels were associated with low CSF Aβ1-42 (r2 > 0.3, p < 0.006), low CSF t-tau (r2 > 0.3, p < 0.001), increased cortical atrophy (p < 0.05) and reduced glucose metabolism (p < 0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
Low levels of CSF NPTX2, a protein implicated in inhibitory circuit function, is common to sporadic and genetic forms of AD.

Although significant progress has been made in surgical techniques, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, the prognosis is still poor. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted substantial attention as tumor-targeted cellular carriers for cancer gene therapy. We have previously shown that recombinant baculovirus-adeno-associated vectors (BV-AAV) possessed high efficiency for multi-gene coexpression in human bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) and BV-AAV-engineered BMSCs could effectively target hypopharyngeal cancer tissues in vivo. However, it was not clear whether BV-AAV-engineered BMSCs as cellular vehicles, mediating the expression of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS), would be effective in controlling the growth of hypopharyngeal carcinoma by radioiodine therapy. We constructed a hybrid BV-AAV containing the Luc-P2A-eGFP fusion or NIS sequence to modify BMSCs (BMSCs-Bac-Luc-P2A-eGFP or BMSCs-Bac-NIS). The 125I uptake of BMSCs-Bac-NIS was analyzed by an automatic gamma counter in vitro and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging in vivo. The value of radioiodine therapy for hypopharyngeal carcinoma was evaluated by measuring tumor volume, glucose metabolism (via 2-deoxy-2-[18F] glucose [18F-FDG] positron emission tomography/CT), and proliferation of tumor cells. We demonstrated that 125I uptake of BMSCs-Bac-NIS persists over long-term in vitro (at least 8 h). Radioactive uptake could be detected by SPECT/CT 1 h after 125I injection in the BMSCs-Bac-NIS group, showing that this strategy allows for the tracking of real-time migration and transgene expression of BMSCs. Radioiodine therapy resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth (386.93 ± 249.23 mm3 vs 816.56 ± 213.87 mm3 in controls), increased survival, and decreased SUVmax of 18F-FDG.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with Gadolinium 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N',N″,N''',N″″-tetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA) enables assessment of myocardial perfusion during first-pass of the contrast agent, while increased retention can signify areas of myocardial infarction (MI). We studied whether Gallium-68-labeled analog, 68Ga-DOTA, can be used to assess myocardial perfusion on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in rats, comparing it with 11C-acetate.


METHODS
Rats were studied with 11C-acetate and 68Ga-DOTA at 24 hours after permanent ligation of the left coronary artery or sham operation. One-tissue compartmental models were used to estimate myocardial perfusion in normal and infarcted myocardium. After the PET scan, hearts were sectioned for autoradiographic detection of 68Ga-DOTA distribution.


RESULTS
11C-acetate PET showed perfusion defects and histology showed myocardial necrosis in all animals after coronary ligation. Kinetic modeling of 68Ga-DOTA showed significantly higher k1 values in normal myocardium than in infarcted areas. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.82, P = 0.001) between k1 values obtained with 68Ga-DOTA and 11C-acetate. After 10 minutes of tracer distribution, the 68Ga-DOTA concentration was significantly higher in the infarcted than normal myocardium on PET imaging and autoradiography.

Loss of brain synapses is an early pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease. The current study assessed synaptic loss in vivo with positron emission tomography and an 18F-labelled radiotracer of the synaptic vesicle protein 2A, [18F]UCB-H.


METHODS
Twenty-four patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease and positive [18F]Flutemetamol amyloid-PET were compared to 19 healthy controls. [18F]UCB-H brain uptake was quantified with Logan graphical analysis using an image-derived blood input function.

RESULTS
A significant decrease of [18F]UCB-H uptake was observed in several cortical areas (11 to 18% difference) and in the thalamus (16% difference), with the largest effect size in the hippocampus (31% difference). Reduced hippocampal uptake was related to patients' cognitive decline (ROI analysis) and unawareness of memory problems (SPM and ROI analyses).


CONCLUSIONS
The findings thus highlight predominant synaptic loss in the hippocampus, confirming previous autopsy-based studies and a recent PET study with an 11C-labelled SV2A radiotracer.

Voxel-wise binding potentials (BPND) for SERT and DAT were determined in 27 patients with SAD and 43 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, using the radioligands [11C]DASB (3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile) and [11C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane). Results showed that, within transmitter systems, SAD patients exhibited higher SERT binding in the nucleus accumbens while DAT availability in the amygdala, hippocampus, and putamen correlated positively with symptom severity. At a more lenient statistical threshold, SERT and DAT BPND were also higher in other striatal and limbic regions in patients, and correlated with symptom severity, whereas no brain region showed higher binding in healthy controls. Moreover, SERT/DAT co-expression was significantly higher in SAD patients in the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen, and posterior ventral thalamus, while lower co-expression was noted in the dorsomedial thalamus. Follow-up logistic regression analysis confirmed that SAD diagnosis was significantly predicted by the statistical interaction between SERT and DAT availability, in the amygdala, putamen, and dorsomedial thalamus. Thus, SAD was associated with mainly increased expression and co-expression of the transporters for serotonin and dopamine in fear and reward-related brain regions. Resultant monoamine dysregulation may underlie SAD symptomatology and constitute a target for treatment.","Molecular psychiatry",31822819,[11C]DASB,"[11C]PE2I (N-(3-iodopro-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4'-methylphenyl)nortropane)",NULL,"reward-related brain regions",NULL

We extracted hippocampal binding potential (BPND) using receptor parametric mapping with cerebellar grey matter as reference region. PVC HDH was performed. Based on our previous study in which we manually eroded 40% ± 10% of voxels of the hippocampus, three hippocampal volumes-of-interest (VOIs) were generated: a non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI [100%], and combining HDH with eroding a percentage of the highest hippocampus BPND voxels (i.e. lowering spill-in) resulting in optimized 50%[50%HDH] and 40%[40%HDH] hippocampal VOIs. Cognitive performance was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Rey auditory verbal learning delayed recall. We performed receiver operating characteristic analyses to investigate which method could best discriminate MCI/AD from controls. Subsequently, we performed linear regressions to investigate associations between the hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND VOIs and MMSE/delayed recall adjusted for age, sex and education.


RESULTS
We found higher hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND in MCI/AD patients (BPND100%=0.27±0.15) compared to CN (BPND100%= 0.07±0.13) and all methods showed comparable discriminative effects (AUC100%=0.85[CI=0.78-0.93]; AUC50%HDH=0.84[CI=0.74-0.92]; AUC40%HDH=0.83[CI=0.74-0.92]). Across groups, higher [18F]flortaucipir BPND was related to lower scores on MMSE (standardized β100%=-0.38[CI=-0.57-0.20]; β50%HDH= -0.37[CI=-0.54-0.19]; β40%HDH=-0.35[CI=-0.53-0.17], all p<0.001) and delayed recall (standardized β100%=-0.64[CI=-0.79-0.49]; β50%HDH= -0.61[CI=-0.76-0.46]; β40%HDH=-0.59[CI=-0.75-0.44]; all p<0.001), with comparable effect sizes for all hippocampal VOIs.


CONCLUSIONS
Hippocampal tau load measured with [18F]flortaucipir PET is strongly associated with cognitive function. Both discrimination between diagnostic groups and associations between hippocampal [18F]flortaucipir BPND and memory were comparable for all methods. The non-optimized 100% hippocampal VOI may be sufficient for clinical interpretation. However, proper correction for choroid plexus spillover and may be required in case of smaller effect sizes between subject groups or for longitudinal studies.","NeuroImage.

In a mouse model of acute bacterial myositis, d-[3-11C]alanine was accumulated by living microorganisms but was not taken up in areas of sterile inflammation. When compared to existing clinical nuclear imaging tools, specifically 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose and a gallium citrate radiotracer, d-alanine showed more bacteria-specific uptake. Decreased d-[3-11C]alanine uptake was also observed in antibiotic-sensitive microbes after antimicrobial therapy, when compared to that in resistant organisms.

[18F]SiTATE (formerly known as [18F]SiFAlin-TATE) was recently introduced as a highly promising imaging agent for the diagnosis of well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NET) using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). A high tumor uptake and excellent image quality, the straightforward labeling approach, as well as the economic and logistic advantages of 18F- over 68Ga-labeled compounds predestinate [18F]SiTATE to become a potential new clinical reference standard. A novel state-of-the-art methodology of automated radiopharmaceutical production is required to establish [18F]SiTATE in clinical routine. This work illustrates the development of a novel synthesis procedure of [18F]SiTATE on an automated synthesis unit (ASU) and the clinical applicability of the tracer in human NET imaging.


METHODS
A new synthesis protocol was generated for the production of [18F]SiTATE on the Scintomics GRP™ platform for clinical NET imaging. The synthesis was carried out according to common Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines including all quality control measurements. To confirm utility, clinical batches (n = 3) were produced and applied to six patients diagnosed with NET.


RESULTS
[18F]SiTATE was obtained in 54 ± 4% (n = 3) non-decay corrected radiochemical yield (RCY), with a radiochemical purity of 96.3 ± 0.1% and a molar activity (Am) of 472 ± 45 GBq/μmol (n = 3). Quality control measurements always met the local release criteria. All specifications were taken or adapted from the Ph.Eur. regulations. PET/CT imaging with [18F]SiTATE produced on the GRP™ module confirmed the expected high image quality. The in vivo distribution pattern and excellent tumor to non-tumor contrast observed, matched the quality of the manually prepared [18F]SiTATE batches.


CONCLUSIONS
The automated manufacture of [18F]SiTATE was developed using the Scintomics GRP™ platform. The high quality of the radiotracer matched stringent quality control requirements adhering to common GMP guidelines, and its clinical applicability was confirmed by human PET/CT investigations.

In this study, we validate one MTH1 inhibitor TH287 as a PET MTH1 radiotracer. TH287 was radiolabeled with tritium and the binding of [3H]TH287 to MTH1 was evaluated in live glioblastoma cells (U251MG) through saturation and competitive binding assays, together with in vitro enzymatic assays. Furthermore, TH287 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 for in vivo microPET studies. Saturation binding assays show that [3H]TH287 has a dissociation constant (Kd) of 1.97 ± 0.18 nM, Bmax of 2676 ± 122 fmol/mg protein for U251MG cells, and nH of 0.98 ± 0.02. Competitive binding assays show that TH287 (Ki: 3.04 ± 0.14 nM) has a higher affinity for MTH1 in U251MG cells compared to another well studied MTH1 inhibitor: (S)-crizotinib (Ki: 153.90 ± 20.48 nM).

42330,"Clinical validation of the novel HDAC6 radiotracer [18F]EKZ-001 in the human brain.","PURPOSE
Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a cytoplasmic enzyme that modulates intracellular transport and protein quality control. Inhibition of HDAC6 deacetylase activity has shown beneficial effects in disease models, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This first-in-human positron emission tomography (PET) study evaluated the brain binding of [18F]EKZ-001 ([18F]Bavarostat), a radiotracer selective for HDAC6, in healthy adult subjects.


METHODS
Biodistribution and radiation dosimetry studies were performed in four healthy subjects (2M/2F, 23.5 ± 2.4 years) using sequential whole-body PET/CT. The most appropriate kinetic model to quantify brain uptake was determined in 12 healthy subjects (6M/6F, 57.6 ± 3.7 years) from 120-min dynamic PET/MR scans using a radiometabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. Four subjects underwent retest scans (2M/2F, 57.3 ± 5.6 years) with a 1-day interscan interval to determine test-retest variability (TRV). Regional volume of distribution (VT) was calculated using one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models (1-2TCM) and Logan graphical analysis (LGA), with time-stability assessed. VT differences between males and females were evaluated using volume of interest and whole-brain voxel-wise approaches.


RESULTS
The effective dose was 39.1 ± 7.0 μSv/MBq. Based on the Akaike information criterion, 2TCM was the preferred model compared to 1TCM. Regional LGA VT were in agreement with 2TCM VT, however demonstrated a lower absolute TRV of 7.7 ± 4.9%. Regional VT values were relatively homogeneous with highest values in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Reduction of acquisition time was achieved with a 0 to 60-min scan followed by a 90 to 120-min scan. Males demonstrated significantly higher VT than females in the majority of cortical and subcortical brain regions. No relevant radiotracer related adverse events were reported.


CONCLUSION
[18F]EKZ-001 is safe and appropriate for quantifying HDAC6 expression in the human brain with Logan graphical analysis as the preferred quantitative approach.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the detection rate of [68Ga]prostate-specific membrane antigen ([68Ga]PSMA-11) positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and to compare it with [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET/X-ray computed tomography (CT) in patients with recurrent prostate cancer (PC) after radical prostatectomy.


PROCEDURES
A total of 93 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer underwent [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET/CT and subsequently a whole-body integrated PET/MRI examination. Board certified nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists evaluated PET/CT and PET/MRI datasets regarding identification of tumor lesions ((i) lymph nodes, (ii) bone lesions, (iii) local recurrence, and (iv) parenchymal lesions) based on maximum [68Ga]PSMA-11 uptake as well as morphological changes. Quality of PET images for both PET/CT and PET/MRI were rated using a 5-point scoring system by evaluating lesion homogeneity, contrast, contour, and delineation. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine statistical differences.


RESULTS
PC relapse was detected in 62/93 patients. PET/MRI detected 148 out of 150 lesions described in PET/CT. In addition, PET/MRI detected 11 lesions not detected in PET/CT (5 lymph nodes, 6 local recurrences). The exact McNemar statistical test (one-sided) showed significant difference between PET/CT and PET/MRI for diagnosis of local recurrence (p value = 0.031). Diagnostic confidence for (iii) was higher in PET/MRI compared with PET/CT (PET/CT = 1.1; PET/MRI = 4.9). Diagnostic confidence for (i) (PET/CT = 4.9; PET/MRI = 4.6), (ii) (PET/CT = 4.9; PET/MRI = 4.6), and (iv) (PET/CT = 4.6; PET/MRI = 4.8) was equivalent between PET/MRI and PET/CT.


CONCLUSIONS
Integrated [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET/MRI provides a similarly high diagnostic performance for localization of recurrent PC as PET/CT.

Gallium-68 labeled synthetic somatostatin analogs for PET/CT imaging are the current gold standard for somatostatin receptor imaging in neuroendocrine tumor patients. Despite good imaging properties, their use in clinical practice is hampered by the low production levels of 68Ga eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga generator. In contrast, 18F-tracers can be produced in large quantities allowing centralized production and distribution to distant PET centers. [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide is a promising tracer that combines a straightforward Al18F-based production procedure with excellent in vivo pharmacokinetics and specific tumor uptake, demonstrated in SSTR2 positive tumor mice. However, advancing towards clinical studies with [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide requires the development of an efficient automated GMP production process and additional preclinical studies are necessary to further evaluate the in vivo properties of [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide. In this study, we present the automated GMP production of [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide on the Trasis AllinOne® radio-synthesizer platform and quality control of the drug product in accordance with GMP. Further, radiometabolite studies were performed and the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide were assessed in healthy rats using μPET/MR.


RESULTS
The production process of [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide has been validated by three validation production runs and the tracer was obtained with a final batch activity of 10.8 ± 1.3 GBq at end of synthesis with a radiochemical yield of 26.1 ± 3.6% (dc), high radiochemical purity and stability (96.3 ± 0.2% up to 6 h post synthesis) and an apparent molar activity of 160.5 ± 75.3 GBq/μmol. The total synthesis time was 40 ± 3 min. Further, the quality control was successfully implemented using validated analytical procedures. Finally, [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide showed high in vivo stability and favorable pharmacokinetics with high and specific accumulation in SSTR2-expressing organs in rats.


CONCLUSION
This robust and automated production process provides high batch activity of [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide allowing centralized production and shipment of the compound to remote PET centers. Further, the production process and quality control developed for [18F]AlF-NOTA-octreotide is easily implementable in a clinical setting and the tracer is a potential clinical alternative for somatostatin directed 68Ga labeled peptides obviating the need for a 68Ge/68Ga-generator.

17695,"Predictive value of integrated 18F-FDG PET/MRI in the early response to nivolumab in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.","BACKGROUND
The early response to treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors is difficult to evaluate. We determined whether changes in integrated [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography/MRI (18F-FDG PET/MRI) parameters after the first 2 weeks of antiprogrammed death-1 antibody nivolumab therapy could predict the response of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).


METHODS
Twenty-five patients with previously treated NSCLC were enrolled prospectively and underwent 18F-FDG PET/MRI before and at 2 weeks after nivolumab therapy. Changes in maximal standardized uptake value, total lesion glycolysis (ΔTLG) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ΔADC) between the two scans were calculated and evaluated for their associations with the clinical response to therapy.


RESULTS
The disease control rate was 64%. Patients with non-progressive disease (non-PD) had significantly decreased TLG, increased ADCmean (ie, negative ΔADCmean) and lower ΔTLG+ΔADCmean than patients with PD. Among the parameters tested, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a cut-off value of 16.5 for ΔTLG+ΔADCmean had the highest accuracy (92%) for distinguishing between patients with non-PD and PD. A ΔTLG+ΔADCmean value <16.5 was significantly associated with longer median progression-free survival (9.0 vs 1.8 months, p<0.00001) and overall survival (23.6 vs 4.7 months, p=0.0001) compared with ΔTLG+ΔADCmean value ≥16.5. A multivariate Cox model revealed that ≥16.5 ΔTLG+ΔADCmean was an independent predictor of shorter progression-free survival (HR 37.7) and overall survival (HR 9.29).


CONCLUSIONS
A combination of ΔTLG and ΔADCmean measured by integrated 18F-FDG PET/MRI may have value as a predictor of the response and survival of patients with NSCLC following nivolumab therapy.

The aim of this study was to develop 18F-labeled PSMA ligands bearing different 18F-glycosyl moieties to study the effect on the in vivo clearance behavior of radiotracers in addition to their tumor binding ability. Therefore, we applied click chemistry-based 18F-fluoroglcosylation using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucosyl azide or 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoroglucosyl azide as prosthetic groups for the radiosynthesis of the 18F-fluoroglycosylated glutamate-urea-lysine-based PSMA inhibitors 2-[18F]FGlc-PSMA ([18F]7) and 6-[18F]FGlc-PSMA ([18F]8). The PSMA inhibitory potencies were determined by competitive radioligand binding assays using 99mTc-MIP-1404 and PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP cells, revealing moderate PSMA inhibitory potencies for [18F]7 (IC50 = 234 nM) and [18F]8 (IC50 = 59 nM). Biodistribution and small-animal PET studies were performed using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP and PSMA-negative PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. PSMA inhibitors [18F]7 and [18F]8 were obtained in high radioactivity yields of 19-22% (nondecay-corrected, referred to [18F]fluoride) and with molar activities of 71-136 GBq/μmol. In the biodistribution studies, the uptake levels of [18F]7 and [18F]8 in PC-3 PIP tumors were 13 ± 3%ID/g and 6 ± 5%ID/g at 60 min p.i., respectively. PSMA-negative PC-3 tumors and all other tissues had negligible low uptake values. Interestingly, [18F]7 had high uptake in the kidneys, with remarkable retention from 30 to 60 min p.i. (74 to 72%ID/g). In contrast, [18F]8 revealed a low uptake of 7.5%ID/g in the kidneys at 30 min p.i. and was rapidly cleared through the kidney (0.9%ID/g at 120 min p.i.). In direct comparison to a 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan of the same mouse, [18F]7 and [18F]8 showed 2- to 3-fold higher uptake values in PC-3 PIP tumors. Both radiotracers were solely cleared via the kidneys and not via the hepatobiliary pathway. The regional kidney distribution pattern of the tracers in the kidneys revealed that 68Ga-PSMA-11 and 2-[18F]FGlc-PSMA([18F]7) mainly accumulated in the cortex of the kidneys, whereas 6-[18F]FGlc-PSMA([18F]8) showed a 10-fold lower kidney uptake with accumulation in the inner medulla or pelvis of the kidneys. Overall, the developed 6-fluoroglucosyl derivative [18F]8, with its considerably low kidney uptake and fast clearance, demonstrated high uptake in PSMA-positive tumors in vivo.

To demonstrate that both 18F-fluoromisonidazole positron emission tomography computed tomography (18F-MISO PET/CT) and function magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level dependent (fMRI BOLD) can map intratumoral sub-region of hypoxia consistently.


METHODS
The MCF-7 xenograft was established and hypoxia were divided into three subtypes by animal 18F-MISO PET/CT scan. Using tumor to background ratio (TBR) >1.40 and hypoxia sub-volume (HSV) / tumor volume (TV) ≧ 50% as threshold, hypoxia was divided into non-hypoxia (NH), diffused-hypoxia (DH) and localized-hypoxia (LH). For NH and DH, unselective ROIs were delineated to calculate ΔT2*. For LH tumor, MIM software was used to fuse the PET/CT and MRI images rigidly and the selective ROIs were delineated to calculate ΔT2*. The ΔT2* of three hypoxic subtypes were compared each other. Finally, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)- 1α was assayed.


RESULTS
62 xenografts were divided into 23 NHs, 11 DHs and 28 LHs. The ΔT2* of NH xenografts (62.80%±21.60%) were significantly different to ΔT2* of DH (15.10%±5.30%) and ΔT2* of hypoxic sub-regions in LH xenografts (16.60%±10.10%) (P<0.001 both). In LH xenografts, ΔT2* of nonhypoxic and hypoxic sub-regions were 50.07%±16.60% and 16.60%±10.10% respectively, which represented a significant difference (t=13.00, P<0.001).

Vascular graft and endograft infection (VGEI) has high morbidity and mortality rates. Diagnosis is complicated because symptoms vary and can be nonspecific. A meta-analysis identified 18F-fluoro-d-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) as the most valuable tool for diagnosis of VGEI and favorable to computed tomography as the current standard. However, the availability and varied use of several interpretation methods, without consensus on which interpretation method is best, complicate clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of different interpretation methods of 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosis of VGEI.


METHODS
A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data sources included PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library. A meta-analysis was conducted on the different interpretation methods for 18F-FDG PET/CT in diagnosis of VGEI, including visual FDG uptake intensity, visual FDG uptake pattern, and quantitative maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax).


RESULTS
Of 613 articles, 13 were included (10 prospective and 3 retrospective articles). The FDG uptake pattern method (I2 = 26.2%) showed negligible heterogeneity, whereas the FDG uptake intensity (I2 = 42.2%) and SUVmax (I2 = 42.1%) methods showed moderate heterogeneity. The pooled sensitivity for FDG uptake intensity was 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-0.96); for uptake pattern, 0.94 (95% CI, 0.89-0.97); and for SUVmax, 0.95 (95% CI, 0.76-0.99). The pooled specificity for FDG uptake intensity was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.78); for FDG uptake pattern, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71-0.88); and for SUVmax, 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.87). The uptake pattern interpretation method demonstrated the best positive and negative post-test probability, 82% and 10%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
This meta-analysis identified the FDG uptake pattern as the most accurate assessment method of 18F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosis of VGEI. The optimal SUVmax cutoff, depending on the vendor, demonstrated strong sensitivity and moderate specificity.","Journal of vascular surgery",32645420,18F-fluoro-d-deoxyglucose,"18F-FDG PET/CT",VGEI,NULL,NULL

4-(N-(S-glutathionylacetyl)amino) phenylarsonous acid (GSAO) when conjugated at the γ-glutamyl residue with fluorophores and radio-isotopes is able to image dead and dying cells in vitro and in vivo by binding to intracellular 90-kDa heat shock proteins (hsp90) when cell membrane integrity is compromised. The ability to image cell death has potential clinical impact especially for early treatment response assessment in oncology. This work aims to assess the biodistribution and tumour uptake of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid GSAO labelled with 111In ([111In]In-DTPA-GSAO) and 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid GSAO labelled with 67Ga ([67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO) in a murine subcutaneous tumour xenograft model and estimate dosimetry of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO.


RESULTS
There was good tumour uptake of both [111In]In-DTPA-GSAO and [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO (2.44 ± 0.26% injected activity per gramme of tissue (%IA/g) and 2.75 ± 0.34 %IA/g, respectively) in Balb c nu/nu mice bearing subcutaneous tumour xenografts of a human metastatic prostate cancer cell line (PC3M-luc-c6). Peak tumour uptake occurred at 2.7 h post injection. [111In]In-DTPA-GSAO and [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO demonstrated increased uptake in the liver (4.40 ± 0.86 %IA/g and 1.72 ± 0.27 %IA/g, respectively), kidneys (16.54 ± 3.86 %IA/g and 8.16 ± 1.33 %IA/g) and spleen (6.44 ± 1.24 %IA/g and 1.85 ± 0.44 %IA/g); however, uptake in these organs was significantly lower with [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO (p = 0.006, p = 0.017 and p = 0.003, respectively). Uptake of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO into tumour was higher than all organs except the kidneys. There was negligible uptake in the other organs. Excretion of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO was more rapid than [111In]In-DTPA-GSAO. Estimated effective dose of [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO for an adult male human was 1.54 × 10- 2 mSv/MBq.


CONCLUSIONS
[67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO demonstrates higher specific uptake in dead and dying cells within tumours and lower uptake in normal organs than [111In]In-DTPA-GSAO. [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO may be potentially useful for imaging cell death in vivo. Dosimetry estimates for [67Ga]Ga-DOTA-GSAO are acceptable for future human studies.

We present the first in-human brain PET imaging data of the new α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-targeting radioligand (+)-[18F]Flubatine. Aims were to develop a kinetic modeling-based approach to quantify (+)-[18F]Flubatine and compare the data of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); to investigate the partial volume effect (PVE) on regional (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding; and whether (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and cognitive test data respective β-amyloid radiotracer accumulation were correlated.


METHODS
We examined 11 HCs and 9 mild AD patients. All subjects underwent neuropsychological testing and [11C]PiB PET/MRI examination. (+)-[18F]Flubatine PET data were evaluated using full kinetic modeling and regional as well as voxel-based analyses.


RESULTS
With 270-min p.i., the unchanged parent compound amounted to 97 ± 2%. Adequate fits of the time-activity curves were obtained with the 1 tissue compartment model (1TCM). (+)-[18F]Flubatine distribution volume (binding) was significantly reduced in bilateral mesial temporal cortex in AD patients compared with HCs (right 10.6 ± 1.1 vs 11.6 ± 1.4, p = 0.049; left 11.0 ± 1.1 vs 12.2 ± 1.8, p = 0.046; one-sided t tests each). PVE correction increased not only (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding of approximately 15% but also standard deviation of 0.4-70%. Cognitive test data and (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding were significantly correlated in the left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate, and right parietal cortex (r > 0.5, p < 0.05 each). In AD patients, (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and [11C]PiB standardized uptake value ratios were negatively correlated in several regions; whereas in HCs, a positive correlation between cortical (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding and [11C]PiB accumulation in the white matter was found. No adverse event related to (+)-[18F]Flubatine occurred.


CONCLUSION
(+)-[18F]Flubatine is a safe and stable PET ligand. Full kinetic modeling can be realized by 1TCM without metabolite correction. (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding affinity was high enough to detect group differences. Of interest, correlation between white matter β-amyloid PET uptake and (+)-[18F]Flubatine binding indicated an association between white matter integrity and availability of α4β2 nAChRs. Overall, (+)-[18F]Flubatine showed favorable characteristics and has therefore the potential to serve as α4β2 nAChR-targeting PET ligand in further clinical trials.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32935187,(+)-[18F]Flubatine,NULL,"α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor",NULL,NULL
59590,"Assessment of acute bone loading in humans using [18F]NaF PET/MRI.","PURPOSE
The acute effect of loading on bone tissue and physiology can offer important information with regard to joint function in diseases such as osteoarthritis. Imaging studies using [18F]-sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) have found changes in tracer kinetics in animals after subjecting bones to strain, indicating an acute physiological response. The aim of this study is to measure acute changes in NaF uptake in human bone due to exercise-induced loading.


METHODS
Twelve healthy subjects underwent two consecutive 50-min [18F]NaF PET/MRI examinations of the knees, one baseline followed by one post-exercise scan. Quantification of tracer kinetics was performed using an image-derived input function from the popliteal artery. For both scans, kinetic parameters of KiNLR, K1, k2, k3, and blood volume were mapped parametrically using nonlinear regression with the Hawkins model. The kinetic parameters along with mean SUV and SUVmax were compared between the pre- and post-exercise examinations. Differences in response to exercise were analysed between bone tissue types (subchondral, cortical, and trabecular bone) and between regional subsections of knee subchondral bone.


RESULTS
Exercise induced a significant (p < <0.001) increase in [18F]NaF uptake in all bone tissues in both knees, with mean SUV increases ranging from 47% in trabecular bone tissue to 131% in subchondral bone tissue. Kinetic parameters involving vascularization (K1 and blood volume) increased, whereas the NaF extraction fraction [k3/(k2 + k3)] was reduced.


CONCLUSIONS
Bone loading induces an acute response in bone physiology as quantified by [18F]NaF PET kinetics. Dynamic imaging after bone loading using [18F]NaF PET is a promising diagnostic tool in bone physiology and imaging of biomechanics.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31385012,"[18F]NaF PET","[18F]-sodium fluoride",NULL,NULL,NULL

The standard reference region (RR) for amyloid-beta (Aβ) PET studies is the cerebellar grey matter (GMCB), while alternative RRs have mostly been utilized without prior validation against the gold standard. This study compared five commonly used RRs to gold standard plasma input-based quantification using the GMCB.


METHODS
Thirteen subjects from a test-retest (TRT) study and 30 from a longitudinal study were retrospectively included (total: 17 Alzheimer's disease, 13 mild cognitive impairment, 13 controls). Dynamic [11C]PiB PET (90 min) and T1-weighted MR scans were co-registered and time-activity curves were extracted for cortical target regions and the following RRs: GMCB, whole cerebellum (WCB), white matter brainstem/pons (WMBS), whole brainstem (WBS) and eroded subcortical white matter (WMES). A two-tissue reversible plasma input model (2T4k_Vb) with GMCB as RR, reference Logan and the simplified reference tissue model were used to derive distribution volume ratios (DVRs), and standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios were calculated for 40-60 min and 60-90 min intervals. Parameter variability was evaluated using TRT scans, and correlations and agreements with the gold standard (DVR from 2T4k_Vb with GMCB RR) were also assessed. Next, longitudinal changes in SUVs (both intervals) were assessed for each RR. Finally, the ability to discriminate between visually Aβ positive and Aβ negative scans was assessed.


RESULTS
All RRs yielded stable TRT performance (max 5.1% variability), with WCB consistently showing lower variability. All approaches were able to discriminate between Aβ positive and Aβ negative scans, with highest effect sizes obtained for GMCB (range - 0.9 to - 0.7), followed by WCB (range - 0.8 to - 0.6). Furthermore, all approaches provided good correlations with the gold standard (r ≥ 0.78), while the highest bias (as assessed by the regression slope) was observed using WMES (range slope 0.52-0.67), followed by WBS (range slope 0.58-0.92) and WMBS (range slope 0.62-0.91). Finally, RR SUVs were stable across a period of 2.6 years for all except WBS and WMBS RRs (60-90 min interval).

Dynamic PET scans were collected in groups of rTg4510 transgenic mice at 2-11 months of age. Associations between distribution volume ratios (DVR) and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with cerebellum reference were used to determine the optimal scanning time and uptake pattern for each age. Immunohistochemistry staining of neurofibrillary tangles and autoradiography study was performed for ex vivo validation. An SUVR 40-70 min was most consistently correlated with DVR and was used in further analyses. Significant increased 18F-PM-PBB3 uptake in the brain cortex was found in six-month-old mice (+28.9%, p < 0.05), and increased further in the nine-month-old group (+38.8%, p < 0.01). The trend of increased SUVR value remained evident in the hippocampus and striatum regions except for cortex where uptake becomes slightly reduced in 11-month-old animals (+37.3%, p < 0.05). Radioactivity distributions from autoradiography correlate well to the presence of human tau (HT7 antibody) and hyperphosphorylated tau (antibody AT8) from the immunohistochemistry study of the adjacent brain sections. These findings supported that the 40-70 min 18F-PM-PBB3 PET scan with SUVR measurement can detect significantly increased tau deposits in a living rTg4510 transgenic mouse models as early as six-months-old. The result exhibited promising dynamic imaging capability of this novel tau tracer, and the above image characteristics should be considered in the design of longitudinal preclinical tau image studies.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",32290239,18F-PM-PBB3,NULL,six-months-old,NULL,NULL

We enrolled 34 EOAD patients and 9 cognitively normal controls (NC), all of whom underwent 18F-florbetaben and 18F-FP-CIT PET at Samsung Medical Center. We assessed motor symptoms using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and divided the EOAD patients into 2 groups using a UPDRS cutoff of 10. We compared regional florbetaben and FP-CIT uptake across the NC and the 2 EOAD groups with lower and higher UPDRS and investigated the associations between regional florbetaben or FP-CIT uptake and UPDRS in EOAD patients. Among the 30 EOAD patients who were Aβ positive on florbetaben PET, the higher UPDRS (>10) group (n = 9) had a longer disease duration (7.2 ± 3.3 vs. 4.1 ± 1.8, p = 0.002), and had a tendency to have lower Mini-Mental State Examination (9.6 ± 7.9 vs. 15.0 ± 6.0, p = 0.052) than the lower UPDRS (≤10) group (n = 21).

Among the tau PET molecular probes, 18F-AV1451 is characterized by high selectivity for pathologic tau aggregates over amyloid plaques, limited non-specific binding in white and gray matter, and confined off-target binding. The objectives of the study are (1) to quantitatively characterize regional brain tau deposition measured by 18F-AV1451 PET in cognitively normal older adults (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD participants; (2) to evaluate the correlations between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers or Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 18F-AV1451 PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR); and (3) to evaluate the partial volume effects on 18F-AV1451 brain uptake. Methods: The study included total 115 participants (CN = 49, MCI = 58, and AD = 8) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Preprocessed 18F-AV1451 PET images, structural MRIs, and demographic and clinical assessments were downloaded from the ADNI database. A reblurred Van Cittertiteration method was used for voxelwise partial volume correction (PVC) on PET images. Structural MRIs were used for PET spatial normalization and region of interest (ROI) definition in standard space. The parametric images of 18F-AV1451 SUVR relative to cerebellum were calculated. The ROI SUVR measurements from PVC and non-PVC SUVR images were compared. The correlation between ROI 18F-AV1451 SUVR and the measurements of MMSE, CSF total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were also assessed. Results: 18F-AV1451 prominently specific binding was found in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, fusiform, posterior cingulate, temporal, parietal, and frontal brain regions. Most regional SUVRs showed significantly higher uptake of 18F-AV1451 in AD than MCI and CN participants. SUVRs of small regions like amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus were statistically improved by PVC in all groups (p < 0.01). Although there was an increasing tendency of 18F-AV-1451 SUVRs in MCI group compared with CN group, no significant difference of 18F-AV1451 deposition was found between CN and MCI brains with or without PVC (p > 0.05). Declined MMSE score was observed with increasing 18F-AV1451 binding in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampus, and fusiform. CSF p-tau was positively correlated with 18F-AV1451 deposition. PVC improved the results of 18F-AV-1451 tau deposition and correlation studies in small brain regions. Conclusion: The typical deposition of 18F-AV1451 tau PET imaging in AD brain was found in amygdala, entorhinal cortex, fusiform and parahippocampus, and these regions were strongly associated with cognitive impairment and CSF biomarkers. Although more deposition was observed in MCI group, the 18F-AV-1451 PET imaging could not differentiate the MCI patients from CN population. More tau deposition related to decreased MMSE score and increased level of CSF p-tau, especially in ROIs of amygdala, entorhinal cortex and parahippocampus. PVC did improve the results of tau deposition and correlation studies in small brain regions and suggest to be routinely used in 18F-AV1451 tau PET quantification.","Frontiers in neurology",31156534,18F-AV1451,"non-PVC SUVR",CN,NULL,PVC
62581,"Nucleophosmin 1 overexpression correlates with 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and improves diagnostic accuracy in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.","PURPOSE
This study investigated the correlation of nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) expression with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computerised tomography scan (PET/CT)-related parameters and compared the diagnostic value of NPM1 with that of the positive biomarker TTF1 in lung adenocarcinoma patients.


METHODS
Forty-six lung adenocarcinoma patients who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT before pulmonary surgery were retrospectively analysed. Metabolic parameters including SUVmax, SUVmean, metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were calculated from 18F-FDG PET imaging data. The expression levels of NPM1 and TTF1 were assessed using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and immunohistochemistry of tumour tissues and adjacent normal lung tissues. We examined the association between the frequency of NPM1 and TTF1 expression and the metabolic parameters.


RESULTS
Lung adenocarcinoma samples expressed higher levels of NPM1 than adjacent normal lung epithelial tissues. NPM1 showed higher specificity and sensitivity for lung adenocarcinoma compared with TTF1 (p < 0.001). SUVmax, SUVmean and TLG correlated with NPM1 expression (p < 0.001). MTV was inversely correlated with TTF1 (p < 0.01). SUVmax was the primary predictor of NPM1 expression by lung adenocarcinoma (p < 0.01). A cutoff value for the SUVmax of 3.93 allowed 90.9% sensitivity and 84.6% specificity for predicting NPM1 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma.


CONCLUSION
NPM1 overexpression correlated with 18F-FDG PET/CT metabolic parameters and improved diagnostic accuracy in lung adenocarcinoma. SUVmax on 18F-FDG PET/CT may estimate NPM1 expression for targeted therapy of lung adenocarcinoma.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32856112,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NPM1,NULL,NULL
67664,"A nanobody-based nuclear imaging tracer targeting dipeptidyl peptidase 6 to determine the mass of human beta cell grafts in mice.","AIMS/HYPOTHESIS
Type 1 diabetes is characterised by a progressive decline in beta cell mass. This is also observed following implantation of pancreatic islet allografts, but there is no reliable information regarding the time course of beta cell loss. This is due to the limited availability of non-invasive pancreatic islet imaging techniques. We have previously described that dipeptidyl peptidase 6 (DPP6) is an alpha and beta cell-specific biomarker, and developed a camelid antibody (nanobody '4hD29') against it. We demonstrated the possibility to detect DPP6-expressing cells by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/ computed tomography (CT), but the correlation between the number of cells grafted and the SPECT signal was not assessed. Here, we investigate whether the 4hD29 nanobody allows us to detect different amounts of human pancreatic islets implanted into immune-deficient mice. In addition, we also describe the adaptation of the probe for use with positron emission tomography (PET).


METHODS
DPP6 expression was assessed in human samples using tissue arrays and immunohistochemistry. The effect of the 4hD29 nanobody on cell death and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was measured in EndoC-βH1 cells and in human islets using Hoechst/propidium iodide staining and an anti-insulin ELISA, respectively. We performed in vivo SPECT imaging on severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice transplanted with different amounts of EndoC-βH1 cells (2 × 106, 5 × 106 and 10 × 106 cells), human islets (1000 and 3000) or pancreatic exocrine tissue using 99mTc-labelled 4hD29 nanobody. This DPP6 nanobody was also conjugated to N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), radiolabelled with either 67Ga (SPECT) or 68Ga (PET) and used in a proof-of-principle experiment to detect DPP6-expressing cells (Kelly neuroblastoma) grafted in SCID mice.


RESULTS
The DPP6 protein is mainly expressed in pancreatic islets. Importantly, the anti-DPP6 nanobody 4hD29 allows non-invasive detection of high amounts of EndoC-βH1 cells or human islets grafted in immunodeficient mice. This suggests that the probe must be further improved to detect lower numbers of islet cells. The 4hD29 nanobody neither affected beta cell viability nor altered insulin secretion in EndoC-βH1 cells and human islets. The conversion of 4hD29 nanobody into a PET probe was successful and did not alter its specificity.


CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION
These findings suggest that the anti-DPP6 4hD29 nanobody may become a useful tool for the quantification of human islet grafts in mice and, pending future development, islet mass in individuals with diabetes.",Diabetologia,31873789,68Ga,"(NCS)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid","anti-DPP6 4hD29 nanobody",NULL,"EndoC-βH1 cells"

The hemocompatibility of a candidate DMCA with human blood is essential for the investigation of its application in vivo. In this respect, here we focused on the evaluation of the hemocompatibility of a new DMCA, that is based on iron oxide nanoparticles (i.e. Fe3O4 magnetite), with human red blood cells (RBCs). The specific iron oxide nanoparticles are surface functionalized with 2,3-dicarboxypropane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (-DPD) and radiolabeled with gallium-68 (68Ga), resulting in 68Ga-DPD-Fe3O4. RBCs of five healthy individuals are incubated at room temperature for 120 min without and with 68Ga-DPD-Fe3O4 at concentrations 0.1 and 1.0 mg/ml. Optical microscopy (OM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are employed to assess detailed information on the overall morphological and geometrical characteristics of the entire cell at the microscopic (10-6 m) level and on the membrane morphology at the nanoscopic (10-9 m) level. In addition, a standard hematology analyzer (HA) is used to obtain complete blood count information. At the microscopic level, the combined OM, AFM and HA data revealed that the overall shape/size characteristics of RBCs were preserved upon incubation with 68Ga-DPD-Fe3O4. However, at the nanoscopic level, the AFM results revealed two different kinds of local deconstructions of the RBCs membrane, termed holes and ulcer-like abnormalities, that were observed in both the DMCA-free and DMCA-incubated samples. Holes did not exhibit any statistically significant difference upon incubation with the 68Ga-DPD-Fe3O4 DMCA. On the contrary, ulcer-like abnormalities exhibited two statistically significant differences upon incubation with the 68Ga-DPD-Fe3O4 DMCA. First, increased percentage of RBCs having at least one ulcer-like abnormality; in DMCA-incubated samples 78.6 ± 11.6% for CDMCA = 0.1 mg/ml and 80.4 ± 11.1% for CDMCA = 1.0 mg/ml, while in DMCA-free samples 61.2 ± 8.4% prior to and 63.6 ± 13.5% after incubation.

43754,"Concurrent Injection of Unlabeled Antibodies Allows Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Programmed Cell Death Ligand 1 Expression in an Orthotopic Pancreatic Tumor Model.","Purpose: Among the treatment options for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are antibodies against the programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway. Positron emission tomography (PET) has been successfully used to assess PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in subcutaneous tumor models, but orthotopic tumor models are increasingly being recognized as a better option to accurately recapitulate human disease. However, when PET radiotracers have high uptake in the liver and spleen, it can obscure signals from the adjacent pancreas, making visualization of the response in orthotopic pancreatic tumors technically challenging. In this study, we first investigated the impact of radioisotope chelators on the biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies and compared the distribution profiles of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies. We then tested the hypothesis that co-injection of unlabeled antibodies reduces uptake of 64Cu-labeled anti-PD-L1 antibodies in the spleen and thereby permits accurate delineation of orthotopic pancreatic tumors in mice. Procedures: We established subcutaneous and orthotopic mouse models of PDAC using KRAS* murine pancreatic cancer cells with a doxycycline-inducible mutation of KRASG12D. We then (1) compared the biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled anti-PD-1 with 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) and 2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) used as the chelators in the orthotopic model; (2) compared the biodistribution of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-1 and [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-L1 in the orthotopic model; and (3) imaged subcutaneous and orthotopic KRAS* tumors with [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-L1 with and without co-injection of unlabeled anti-PD-L1 as the blocking agent. Results: [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-L1 was a promising imaging probe. By co-injection of an excess of unlabeled anti-PD-L1, background signals of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-L1 from the spleen were significantly reduced, leading to a clear delineation of orthotopic pancreatic tumors. Conclusions: Co-injection with unlabeled anti-PD-L1 is a useful method for PET imaging of PD-L1 expression in orthotopic pancreatic cancer models.","ACS omega",32337408,[64Cu]Cu-NOTA-anti-PD-L1,"64Cu-labeled anti-PD-1",PD-L1,NULL,NULL

49757,"Optimization of solid-phase extraction (SPE) in the preparation of [18F]D3FSP: A new PET imaging agent for mapping Aβ plaques.","INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer's disease is a common neurodegenerative disease that is characterized by the presence of Aβ plaques in the brain. The FDA has approved the use of Amyvid (florbetapir f18, AV-45) as a PET imaging agent for detecting Aβ plaques in the living human brain. In an attempt to reduce N-demethylation in vivo by taking advantage of more stable C-D bonds, an analog of AV-45, [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7), was synthesized to improve image contrast for detecting and monitoring the Aβ plaques. A convenient and improved preparation of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) is needed for widespread clinical application. We report herein the optimization of the radiosynthesis and solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure.


METHODS
Radiosyntheses of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) under different fluorination conditions were evaluated, and the intermediate, containing an N-Boc protecting group, was deprotected using different acids. One of the major objectives was to simplify the final purification step via SPE to avoid the commonly employed HPLC purification and maximize the radiochemical yields of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) while simultaneously removing several chemical impurities (pseudocarriers). Washing various solid-phase cartridges with different combinations of ethanol/water and acetonitrile/water was explored to optimize the purification step. To evaluate the potential interference in Aβ plaques imaging from the presence of pseudocarriers, each chemical was identified and quantified by LC/MS and HPLC. An in vitro binding assay was employed to evaluate the binding affinities of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) and the pseudocarriers to Aβ plaques using postmortem AD brain tissue.


RESULTS
Using the optimized radiosynthesis method and SPE purification, the final dose of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) was obtained in 50 min with a very low content of pseudocarriers (21.7 ± 5.5 μg). The radiochemical yield was 44.4 ± 5.7% (decay corrected), and the radiochemical purity was >95%. SPE-purified doses of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) displayed excellent binding affinity and specificity for Aβ plaques as measured in an in vitro binding assay using AD brain homogenates, and the OH-pseudocarrier, 8 (Ki = 19.5 ± 0.5 nM), and the Cl-pseudocarrier, 10 (Ki = 18.6 ± 3.9 nM), showed lower binding affinities for Aβ plaques than those of AV-45 (Ki = 8.6 ± 0.5 nM) and D3FSP, 7 (Ki = 9.8 ± 0.5 nM).


CONCLUSIONS
An optimized radiosynthesis and fast SPE purification method suitable for the preparation of clinical doses of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) was accomplished. The results of quality control tests and binding studies suggested that the SPE-purified doses of [18F]D3FSP ([18F]7) are appropriate for imaging Aβ plaques in the human brain.","Nuclear medicine and biology",31152974,[18F]7,[18F]7),NULL,NULL,NULL

To quantify Na18F-PET/CT uptake in relation to clinical and biochemical parameters of fibrous dysplasia (FD) severity and healthy bone (HB) metabolism. Secondary aims: comparing normalization for volume of distribution and determining reproducibility of Na18F-PET/CT uptake parameters in HB and FD. Relating Na18F uptake to skeletal burden score (SBS), bisphosphonate therapy and pain measured by Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).


METHODS
In a prospective cohort study (n = 20), Na18F-PET/CT parameters of HB and FD were assessed by two independent readers to determine the cutoff defining increased bone uptake, optimized normalization, and interobserver agreement (ICC) and were related to SBS, serum biomarkers, medication, and clinical parameters.


RESULTS
Physiological bone standardized uptake value (SUV) was best normalized but displayed large interpatient variation (total range 4.1-13.7 g/mL), with very high interobserver agreement (ICC = 0.964). FD burden defined by patient-specific SUV cutoffs reached near-perfect agreement for SUVpeak (ICC = 0.994) and total lesion fluorination (TLF) (ICC = 0.999). TLF correlated weakly with SBS (R2 = 0.384, p = 0.047). TLF correlated positively with serum alkaline phosphatase (R2 = 0.571, p = 0.004) and procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (R2 = 0.621, p = 0.002), SBS did not (p > 0.06). SBS and TLF both correlated with increased fibroblast growth factor-23 (R2 = 0.596, p = 0.007 and R2 = 0.541, p = 0.015, respectively). TLF was higher in use of bisphosphonates (p = 0.023), SBS was not. Average BPI scores correlated to increased FGF-23 (R2 = 0.535, p = 0.045), work-related BPI scores to higher SBS (R2 = 0.518, p = 0.024), higher TLF (R2 = 0.478, p = 0.036), and higher levels of FGF-23 (R2 = 0.567, p = 0.034).


CONCLUSIONS
Individualized Na18F-PET/CT SUV cutoffs reproducibly discriminated HB from FD and were well-normalized. The strong relations of bone formation serum markers with Na18F-PET/CT FD burden measurements suggest clinical relevance over SBS as an adjunct instrument in FD patients. The correlation of both imaging modalities with increased work-related BPI scores also indicates clinical applicability. Moreover, SBS is known to remain stationary irrespective of use of medication, whereas TLF on Na18F-PET/CT was higher in baseline patients using bisphosphonates. This makes Na18F-PET/CT a promising tool to quantitatively measure treatment efficacy in FD.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31875244,Na18F-PET/CT,"Na18F-PET/CT FD",TLF,SBS,"TLF (R2 = "

Methods: Patients scheduled to undergo 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively recruited in the study from January to December 2019, regardless of the indication/underlying disease. Patients were divided into four groups and injected different amounts of 18F-FDG radioactivity/kg body weight (1.85 MBq/kg, 3.7 MBq/kg, 5.5 MBq/kg and 7.4 MBq/kg). All patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT studies and NECRlocal was calculated by noting the trues rate, total prompts and randoms rate for each bed position. Whole body NECRglobal was calculated as average of NECR for all bed positions. Qualitative IQ assessment was done for each bed-position (IQlocal) and for whole-body PET (IQglobal) by two readers using 5-point scores based on prevalence of noise, contrast and lesion detectability. Values of NECR and IQ in all four activity groups were compared. Patients were also subdivided into four body mass index (BMI) groups [group I-15-20(kg/m2), group II-20.1-25 (kg/m2), group III-25.1-30 (kg/m2) and group IV-30.1-35 (kg/m2)] for comparison.

Results: A total of 109 patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT studies after injecting different amounts of 18F-FDG radioactivity and a mean uptake time of 62.32 minutes. Mean value of NECRglobal and IQglobal for each group were found to be significantly different from other groups (p<0.05), with higher NECR and IQ values in high-activity groups in comparison to low-activity groups. The overall image quality was acceptable in all patients, even in lowest-activity group (1.84 MBq/Kg).

27692,"Multimodal Imaging Probe Development for Pancreatic β Cells: From Fluorescence to PET.","Pancreatic β cells are responsible for insulin secretion and are important for glucose regulation in a healthy body and diabetic disease patient without prelabeling of islets. While the conventional biomarkers for diabetes have been glucose and insulin concentrations in the blood, the direct determination of the pancreatic β cell mass would provide critical information for the disease status and progression. By combining fluorination and diversity-oriented fluorescence library strategy, we have developed a multimodal pancreatic β cell probe PiF for both fluorescence and for PET (positron emission tomography). By simple tail vein injection, PiF stains pancreatic β cells specifically and allows intraoperative fluorescent imaging of pancreatic islets. PiF-injected pancreatic tissue even facilitated an antibody-free islet analysis within 2 h, dramatically accelerating the day-long histological procedure without any fixing and dehydration step. Not only islets in the pancreas but also the low background of PiF in the liver allowed us to monitor the intraportal transplanted islets, which is the first in vivo visualization of transplanted human islets without a prelabeling of the islets. Finally, we could replace the built-in fluorine atom in PiF with radioactive 18F and successfully demonstrate in situ PET imaging for pancreatic islets.","Journal of the American Chemical Society",32040300,NULL,"radioactive 18F",PiF,NULL,NULL

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1, CD54) is an emerging therapeutic target for a variety of solid tumors including melanoma and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). This study aims to develop an ICAM-1-targeted immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) imaging strategy and assess its diagnostic value in melanoma and ATC models.


METHODS
Flow cytometry was used to screen ICAM-1-positive melanoma and ATC cell lines. Melanoma and ATC models were established using A375 cell line and THJ-16T cell line, respectively. An ICAM-1-specific monoclonal antibody (R6-5-D6) and a nonspecific human IgG were radiolabeled with 64Cu and the diagnostic efficacies were interrogated in tumor-bearing mouse models. Biodistribution and fluorescent imaging studies were performed to confirm the specificity of the ICAM-1-targeted imaging probes.


RESULTS
ICAM-1 was strongly expressed on melanoma and advanced thyroid cancer cell lines. 64Cu-NOTA-ICAM-1 immunoPET imaging efficiently delineated A375 melanomas with a peak tumor uptake of 21.28 ± 6.56 %ID/g (n = 5), significantly higher than that of 64Cu-NOTA-IgG (10.63 ± 2.58 %ID/g, n = 3). Moreover, immunoPET imaging with 64Cu-NOTA-ICAM-1 efficiently visualized subcutaneous and orthotopic ATCs with high clarity and contrast. Fluorescent imaging with IRDye 800CW-ICAM-1 also visualized orthotopic ATCs and the tumor uptake could be blocked by the ICAM-1 parental antibody R6-5-D6, indicating the high specificity of the developed probe. Finally, blocking with the human IgG prolonged the circulation of the 64Cu-NOTA-ICAM-1 in R2G2 mice without compromising the tumor uptake.


CONCLUSION
ICAM-1-targeted immunoPET imaging could characterize ICAM-1 expression in melanoma and ATC, which holds promise for optimizing ICAM-1-targeted therapies in the future.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32279097,64Cu-NOTA-ICAM-1,R6-5-D6,ICAM-1,NULL,"thyroid cancer cell lines"

Preclinical in vivo nuclear imaging of mice offers an enabling perspective to evaluate drug efficacy at optimal dose and schedule. In this study, we interrogated sufficient estrogen receptor occupancy and degradation for the selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) compound SAR439859 using molecular imaging and histological techniques.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
[18F]FluoroEstradiol positron emission tomography (FES-PET), [18F]FluoroDeoxyGlucose (FDG) PET, and [18F]FluoroThymidine (FLT) PET were investigated as early pharmacodynamic, tumor metabolism, and tumor proliferation imaging biomarkers, respectively, in mice bearing subcutaneous MCF7-Y537S mutant ERα+ breast cancer model treated with the SERD agent SAR439859. ER expression and proliferation index Ki-67 were assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The combination of palbociclib CDK 4/6 inhibitor with SAR439859 was tested for its potential synergistic effect on anti-tumor activity.


RESULTS
After repeated SAR439859 oral administration over 4 days, FES tumoral uptake (SUVmean) decreases compared to baseline by 35, 57, and 55% for the 25 mg/kg qd, 12.5 mg/kg bid and 5 mg/kg bid treatment groups, respectively. FES tumor uptake following SAR439859 treatment at different doses correlates with immunohistochemical scoring for ERα expression. No significant difference in FDG uptake is observed after SAR439859 treatments over 3 days. FLT accumulation in tumor is significantly decreased when palbociclib is combined to SAR439859 (- 64%) but not different from the group dosed with palbociclib alone (- 46%). The impact on proliferation is corroborated by Ki-67 IHC data for both groups of treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
In our preclinical studies, dose-dependent inhibition of FES tumoral uptake confirmed target engagement of SAR439859 to ERα. FES-PET thus appears as a relevant imaging biomarker for measuring non-invasively the impact of SAR439859 on tumor estrogen receptor occupancy.

18429,"A microdose clinical trial to evaluate [18F]Florastamin as a positron emission tomography imaging agent in patients with prostate cancer.","PURPOSE
To evaluate the biodistribution of [18F]Florastamin, a novel 18F-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.


METHODS
PET was performed for five healthy controls and 10 patients with prostate cancer at 0, 10, 30, 70, and 120 mins after injecting 370 MBq of [18F]Florastamin. The maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) was evaluated in the primary tumour. The mean SUVmax (SUVmean) was evaluated in normal organs. Furthermore, the residence time was evaluated by assessing radioactivity in each organ. The internal radiation dosimetry was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software.


RESULTS
The SUVmax in primary tumours increased with time. A favourable tumour to background ratio was also observed over time. Multiple lymph nodes and bone metastases were also evaluated and showed a similar pattern to SUVmax in the primary tumour. In one patient, a tiny lymph node metastasis was identified using [18F]Florastamin PET, which was not observed using other modalities, and was histologically confirmed. The highest absorbed dose was observed in the kidney (0.062 ± 0.015 mGy/MBq), followed by the bladder (0.032 ± 0.013 mGy/MBq), liver (0.022 ± 0.006 mGy/MBq), and salivary gland (0.018 ± 0.006 mGy/MBq). The effective dose with a 370 MBq injection of [18F]Florastamin was 1.81 mSv. No adverse events related to [18F]Florastamin were reported.


CONCLUSION
We identified a novel PSMA-targeted PET ligand, [18F]Florastamin, for imaging prostate cancer. [18F]Florastamin showed a high SUVmax and relatively high tumour to background ratio in both primary tumour and metastatic lesions, which suggests its high sensitivity to detect tumours without any adverse events.

35135,"Brain pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 11C-labeled isoproterenol in rodents.","INTRODUCTION
Isoproterenol is a non-selective β receptor agonist, which is a drug approved for bradycardia and bronchial asthma in many countries. Recently, isoproterenol has been reported to have the potential as a drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease by inhibiting the aggregation of tau protein. Isoproterenol is a highly potent drug causing increases in heart rates even when its plasma concentration is very low. Thus, it is critical to know if potentially effective therapeutic levels of isoproterenol can be achieved, maintaining safe plasma levels without any untoward pharmacological effects. The purpose of the study is to investigate the brain pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of 11C-labeled isoproterenol in rodents.


METHODS
We performed positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging and biodistribution studies of [11C]isoproterenol. 120-min scans with arterial blood sampling were performed in rats. Additionally, plasma and brain homogenates were analyzed with radio-HPLC to characterize its metabolite profiles. As a measure of [11C]isoproterenol brain uptake, total distribution volumes were determined by a pharmacokinetic compartment model. Biodistribution of [11C]isoproterenol was investigated in mice at six-time points from 1-min to 90-min after injection.


RESULTS
We found a modest brain uptake of [11C]isoproterenol. Its brain pharmacokinetics showed that the concentration of isoproterenol in the brain at equilibrium was about two-fold higher than in the plasma (total distribution volumes 2.0 ± 0.2 cm3/mL). Only unmetabolized isoproterenol was detected in the brain at 30 min after injection, although isoproterenol was rapidly metabolized in plasma. The biodistribution study showed that isoproterenol and its metabolite are excreted mainly via the urinary system. CONCLUSIONS, ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PATIENT CARE: In this study, we have shown that rat brain concentrations of isoproterenol are only two-fold of that in plasma at equilibrium. If the brain pharmacokinetics are similar in the human brain, it may be difficult to achieve potentially therapeutic levels of this drug safely in humans. Further studies appear warranted to investigate the brain pharmacokinetics in humans with PET using [11C]isoproterenol.","Nuclear medicine and biology",32532591,[11C]isoproterenol,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
55775,"Association between carotid 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT with ischemic vascular brain disease on MRI in patients with carotid artery disease.","OBJECTIVE
Atherosclerosis is a dynamic and complex process characterized by the formation and progression of plaque mediated by various pathophysiologic steps including inflammation and calcification. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between carotid 18F-sodium fluoride (NaF) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake with the severity of ischemic vascular brain disease on MRI in patients with carotid artery disease.


METHODS
A total of 28 patients who were scheduled to undergo clinically indicated carotid endarterectomy or stenting for carotid artery disease were examined with 18F-NaF and 18F-FDG PET/CT and brain MRI. The PET/CT images were evaluated by qualitative and semiquantitative analyses. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) for the plaque and the average of mean SUV within the lumen of both internal jugular veins was calculated, and the target-to-blood pool ratio (TBR) was determined. The ischemic vascular brain disease on MRI was graded separately in the bilateral hemisphere as 0, 1, 2, and 3, with 0 being absent and 3 being the most severe.


RESULTS
In two patients, only a unilateral carotid artery was analyzed because of previous indwelling stent. 18F-NaF focal uptake was observed in 50 carotid arteries. 18F-FDG focal uptake was observed in 47 carotid arteries. The mean (± SD) 18F-NaF TBR (2.93 ± 0.89) was significantly higher than the mean (± SD) 18F-FDG TBR (2.41 ± 0.84) (p < 0.001). The mean (± SD) values of 18F-NaF TBR were 2.63 ± 0.76 in grade 1, 2.90 ± 0.91 in grade 2, and 3.81 ± 0.60 in grade 3. Significant differences in 18F-NaF TBR were observed between grades 1 and 3 (p < 0.001) and grades 2 and 3 (p = 0.02). The mean (± SD) values of 18F-FDG TBR were 2.35 ± 0.77 in grade 1, 2.23 ± 0.48 in grade 2, and 2.87 ± 1.32 in grade 3. No significant differences in 18F-FDG TBR were noted between any of the ischemic vascular brain disease grades.


CONCLUSIONS
These preliminary results suggest that carotid 18F-NaF uptake in patients with carotid artery disease may be associated with the severity of the ischemic vascular brain disease observed on MRI.","Annals of nuclear medicine",31571042,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG TBR",NULL,NULL,NULL

Here, we evaluated the potential of MEMRI to assess myocardial viability compared to gold-standard 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) viability.

MEMRI and PET demonstrated good agreement with histology but native T1 underestimated infarct size. Quantification of viability by MEMRI, PET and MTC were similar, irrespective of manganese agent. MEMRI showed superior agreement with PET than native T1. MEMRI showed excellent agreement with PET and MTC viability. Myocardial MEMRI T1 correlated with 18F-FDG standard uptake values and influx constant but not native T1.

To broaden the spectrum of applicable PET tracers for extended imaging studies of FAP-dependent diseases, we herein report the radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of an 18F-labeled glycosylated FAPI ([18F]FGlc-FAPI). Methods: An alkyne-bearing precursor was synthesized and subjected to click chemistry-based radiosynthesis of [18F]FGlc-FAPI by 2-step 18F-fluoroglycosylation. FAP-expressing HT1080hFAP cells were used to study competitive binding to FAP, cellular uptake, internalization, and efflux of [18F]FGlc-FAPI in vitro. Biodistribution studies and in vivo small-animal PET studies of [18F]FGlc-FAPI compared with [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 were conducted in nude mice bearing HT1080hFAP tumors or U87MG xenografts. Results: [18F]FGlc-FAPI was synthesized with a 15% radioactivity yield and a high radiochemical purity of more than 99%. In HT1080hFAP cells, [18F]FGlc-FAPI showed specific uptake, a high internalized fraction, and low cellular efflux. Compared with FAPI-04 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 32 nM), the glycoconjugate, FGlc-FAPI (IC50 = 167 nM), showed slightly lower affinity for FAP in vitro, whereas plasma protein binding was higher for [18F]FGlc-FAPI. Biodistribution studies revealed significant hepatobiliary excretion of [18F]FGlc-FAPI; however, small-animal PET studies in HT1080hFAP xenografts showed higher specific tumor uptake of [18F]FGlc-FAPI (4.5 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue [%ID/g]) than of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI-04 (2 %ID/g). In U87MG tumor-bearing mice, both tracers showed similar tumor uptake, but [18F]FGlc-FAPI showed a higher tumor retention. Interestingly, [18F]FGlc-FAPI demonstrated high specific uptake in bone structures and joints. Conclusion: [18F]FGlc-FAPI is an interesting candidate for translation to the clinic, taking advantage of the longer half-life and physical imaging properties of 18F.

Here we investigate a pretargeting strategy based on gallium-68 and the chelator THPMe as a high-affinity pair capable of combining in vivo. After confirming the ability of THPMe to bind 68Ga in vivo at low concentrations, the bifunctional THPMe-NCS was conjugated to a humanised huA33 antibody targeting the A33 glycoprotein. Imaging experiments performed in nude mice bearing A33-positive SW1222 colorectal cancer xenografts compared pretargeting (100 μg of THPMe-NCS-huA33, followed after 24 h by 8-10 MBq of 68Ga3+) with both a directly labelled radioimmunoconjugate (89Zr-DFO-NCS-huA33, 88 μg, 7 MBq) and a 68Ga-only negative control (8-10 MBq of 68Ga3+). Imaging was performed 25 h after antibody administration (1 h after 68Ga3+ administration for negative control). No difference between pretargeting and the negative control was observed, suggesting that pretargeting via metal chelation is not feasible using this model. However, significant accumulation of "unchelated" 68Ga3+ in the tumour was found (12.9 %ID/g) even without prior administration of THPMe-NCS-huA33, though tumour-to-background contrast was impaired by residual activity in the blood. Therefore, the 68Ga-only experiment was repeated using THPMe (20 μg, 1 h after 68Ga3+ administration) to clear circulating 68Ga3+, producing a three-fold improvement of the tumour-to-blood activity concentration ratio. Although preliminary, these results highlight the potential of THPMe as a 68Ga clearing agent in imaging applications with gallium citrate.","International journal of molecular sciences",32098299,68Ga,68Ga3+,THPMe,NULL,NULL

To explore the relationship between [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG uptake) and PD-L1 expression and determine the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET/CT for evaluating the PD-L1 status in tumour cells (TCs) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC).


METHODS
We retrospectively evaluated the records of 84 eligible patients who received an initial histopathological diagnosis of NPC between December 2016 and March 2019. All tissue specimens and PET/CT images were collected prior to treatment. High PD-L1 expression in TCs and TIICs was defined as ≥ 50% of stained cells.


RESULTS
There was a significant difference in 18F-FDG uptake according to the PD-L1 status in TCs and TIICs. Univariate analysis showed that PD-L1 expression in TCs was associated with tumour maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) (P < 0.001), primary tumour total lesion glycolysis (TLG; P < 0.001), and T stage (P = 0.044), but not with plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) load (P = 0.816), whereas PD-L1 expression in TIICs was related to SUVmax (P = 0.011), TLG (P = 0.001), T stage (P = 0.028), and plasma EBV load (P = 0.003). In multivariate logistic regression, PD-L1 expression in TCs was positively associated with SUVmax (P = 0.003) and TLG (P = 0.001), and in TIICs, negatively associated with SUVmax (P = 0.038) and plasma EBV load (P = 0.025).


CONCLUSIONS
18F-FDG uptake in NPC lesions was positively correlated with PD-L1 expression in TCs and negatively correlated with PD-L1 expression in TIICs.

This study assessed whether physiological brain activation induces changes in [11C]UCB-J tissue influx (K1), volume of distribution (VT), or binding potential (BPND). Healthy volunteers (n = 7) underwent 60-min [11C]UCB-J PET scans at baseline and during intermittent presentation of 8-Hz checkerboard visual stimulation. Sensitivity to intermittent changes in kinetic parameters was assessed in simulations, and visual stimulation was repeated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize neural responses. VT  and K1 were determined using the one-tissue compartment model and BPND using the simplified reference tissue model. In primary visual cortex, K1 increased 34.3 ± 15.5% (p = 0.001) during stimulation, with no change in other regions (ps > 0.12). K1 change was correlated with fMRI BOLD response (r = 0.77, p = 0.043). There was no change in VT (-3.9 ± 8.8%, p = 0.33) or BPND (-0.2 ± 9.6%, p = 0.94) in visual cortex nor other regions (ps > 0.19). Therefore, despite robust increases in regional tracer influx due to blood flow increases, binding measures were unchanged during stimulation. [11C]UCB-J VT and BPND are likely to be stable in vivo measures of synaptic density.","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism",32757741,"[11C]UCB-J PET","[11C]UCB-J VT",SV2A,"binding site",NULL
5989,"Comparison of different images in gross target volume delineating on VX2 nasopharyngeal transplantation tumor models.","Background: To determine the optimum conditions for diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we established VX2 rabbit model to delineate gross target volume (GTV) in different imaging methods. Methods: The orthotopic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) was established in sixteen New Zealand rabbits. After 7-days inoculation, the rabbits were examined by CT scanning and then sacrificed for pathological examination. To achieve the best delineation, different GTVs of CT, MRI, 18F-FDG PET/CT, and 18F-FLT PET/CT images were correlated with pathological GTV (GTVp). Results: We found 45% and 60% of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) as the optimal SUV threshold for the target volume of NPC in 18F-FDG PET/CT and 18F-FLT PET/CT images, respectively (GTVFDG45% and GTVFLT60%). Moreover, the GTVMRI and GTVCT were significantly higher than the GTVp (P ≤ 0.05), while the GTVFDG45% and especially GTVFLT60% were similar to the GTVp (R = 0.892 and R = 0.902, respectively; P ≤ 0.001). Conclusions: Notably, the results suggested that 18F-FLT PET/CT could reflect the tumor boundaries more accurately than 18F-FDG PET/CT, MRI and CT, which makes 18F-FLT PET-CT more advantageous for the clinical delineation of the target volume in NPC.","Journal of Cancer",31956357,"18F-FLT PET-CT","18F-FDG PET/CT",NPC,NULL,NULL

All participants underwent 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) PET, and all DLB patients had abnormality on dopamine transporter PET.

Compared with the control group, the DLB and AD groups commonly exhibited hypometabolism in the bilateral lateral temporal, temporo-parietal junction, posterior cingulate, and precuneus cortices. Both DLB groups had additional hypometabolism in the bilateral thalami and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, whereas the AD group did in the bilateral entorhinal cortices and hippocampi. Our results suggest that hypermetabolism in the somatomotor cortex, posterior putamen, or central cerebellum could be a useful imaging biomarker for detecting DLB patients, while entorhinal/hippocampal hypometabolism could be a specific biomarker for AD.","Neurobiology of aging",31791660,18F-Florbetaben,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL
9327,"High-Contrast CXCR4-Targeted 18F-PET Imaging Using a Potent and Selective Antagonist.","C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is highly expressed in cancers, contributing to proliferation, metastasis, and a poor prognosis. The noninvasive imaging of CXCR4 can enable the detection and characterization of aggressive cancers with poor outcomes. Currently, no 18F-labeled CXCR4 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer has demonstrated imaging contrast comparable to [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor, a CXCR4-targeting radioligand. We, therefore, aimed to develop a high-contrast CXCR4-targeting radiotracer by incorporating a hydrophilic linker and trifluoroborate radioprosthesis to LY2510924, a known CXCR4 antagonist. A carboxy-ammoniomethyl-trifluoroborate (PepBF3) moiety was conjugated to the LY2510924-derived peptide possessing a triglutamate linker via amide bond formation to obtain BL08, whereas an alkyne ammoniomethyl-trifluoroborate (AMBF3) moiety was conjugated using the copper-catalyzed [3+2] cycloaddition click reaction to obtain BL09. BL08 and BL09 were radiolabeled with [18F]fluoride ion using 18F-19F isotope exchange. Pentixafor was radiolabeled with [68Ga]GaCl3. Side-by-side PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on immunocompromised mice bearing Daudi Burkitt lymphoma xenografts. The biodistribution of [18F]BL08 and [18F]BL09 showed tumor uptake at 2 h postinjection (p.i.) (5.67 ± 1.25%ID/g and 5.83 ± 0.92%ID/g, respectively), which were concordant with the results of PET imaging. [18F]BL08 had low background activity, providing tumor-to-blood, -muscle, and -liver ratios of 72 ± 20, 339 ± 81, and 14 ± 3 (2 h p.i.), respectively. [18F]BL09 behaved similarly, with ratios of 64 ± 20, 239 ± 72, and 17 ± 3 (2 h p.i.), respectively. This resulted in high-contrast visualization of tumors on PET imaging for both radiotracers. [18F]BL08 exhibited lower kidney uptake (2.2 ± 0.5%ID/g) compared to [18F]BL09 (7.6 ± 1.0%ID/g) at 2 h p.i. [18F]BL08 and [18F]BL09 demonstrated higher tumor-to-blood, -muscle, and -liver ratios compared to [68Ga]Ga-Pentixafor (18.9 ± 2.7, 95.4 ± 36.7, and 5.9 ± 0.7 at 2 h p.i., respectively). In conclusion, [18F]BL08 and [18F]BL09 enable high-contrast visualization of CXCR4 expression in Daudi xenografts. Based on high tumor-to-organ ratios, [18F]BL08 may prove a valuable new tool for CXCR4-targeted PET imaging with potential for translation. The use of a PepBF3 moiety is a new approach for the orthogonal conjugation of organotrifluoroborates for 18F-labeling of peptides.","Molecular pharmaceutics",33253591,[18F]BL08,"18F-labeling of peptides","PepBF3 moiety",BL09,"Daudi Burkitt lymphoma xenografts"

Several genetic analyses have identified tumor diversity not only among tumors from different patients (intertumor heterogeneity) but also within individual tumors (intratumor heterogeneity). The aim of this study was to analyze the intratumor heterogeneity and other biological parameters based on in vivo distribution in triple-tracer positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET/CT) study in patients with newly diagnosed head and neck (H&N) cancer.


METHODS
Thirty-six patients with newly diagnosed H&N cancer were included in the study. Institutional Bioethical Committee approved the study protocol and informed consent was received from every participant. All patients underwent series of 3 PET/CT scans with [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG-PET), [18F]Fluorothymidine (18F-FLT-PET), and [18F]Fluoromisonidazole (18F-FMISO-PET) before treatment. Scans were performed on separate days, within a timeframe of 2 weeks. Several PET/CT parameters grading tumor biology including maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), its equivalent (total hypoxic lesion [TLH] and total proliferative lesion [TLP]), and heterogeneity (area under the curve-cumulative SUV histogram) for the primary tumor were compared.


RESULTS
All patients showed increased uptake of 18F-FDG in primary tumor, ranging from 2.29 to 14.89 SUVmax. Respectively, SUVmax values for 18F-FLT ranged from 0.93 to 16.11 and for 18F-FMISO 0.36-4.07. Based on 3-year follow-up, we divided patients in terms of survival forecasts (first with good prognosis and second with worse). Higher values of TLG/TLP/TLH and SUVmax were observed in the second group in all 3 tracers (for 18F-FDG: 167.40 vs 100.32, 11.15 vs 8.95; for 18F-FLT: 116.61 vs 60.67, 7.09 vs 5.47; for 18F-FMISO: 37.34 vs 22.30, 1.70 vs 1.61 respectively). Statistically significant differences were shown in SUVmax in 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT (P<0.034, P<0.034, respectively; in TLG, P=0.05; TLP, P=0.04; and TLH, P=0.05).


CONCLUSION
Our preliminary results suggest worse prognosis in patients with higher heterogeneity values of primary tumor in proliferation and hypoxia images and combination of metabolic and volumetric parameters in TLG and its equivalent and heterogeneity of primary tumor seems to be a prognostic factor.",Tumori,31446858,18F-FLT,"18F-FMISO: 37.34",NULL,NULL,NULL
15111,"Comparison of histopathology and preoperative 18F-FDG-PET/CT of osteomyelitis aiming for image guided surgery: A preliminary trial.","OBJECTIVE
There are currently no robust methods for accurately localizing the infection focus of osteomyelitis. Accumulation of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is nonspecific, and it is well-known that it can indicate inflammatory cells and sites of inflammation, and its effectiveness in detecting osteomyelitis has been reported recently. However, the optimal cut-off value for the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) in detecting the focus of osteomyelitis through 18F-FDG-PET/CT is not known. We investigated the optimal SUV cut-off values using 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET)computed tomography (CT) to visualize the infection focus of osteomyelitis accurately.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Initially, we investigated a case where osteomyelitis was bacteriologically detected after orthopedic surgery on lower limb. Based on the surgical pathology, we explored the optimal SUV cut-off value of the 18F-FDG PET/CT image taken before surgery. The SUV cut-off value was varied, using the GE Rainbow Color Scale on a dedicated workstation. We searched for the most accurate visualization of the extent of the infectious lesion. Subsequently, using the SUV cut-off value decided on the basis of the first case studied, we investigated the accuracy for diagnosing osteomyelitis. A total of sixteen patients underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT for suspected osteomyelitis (one case involved the upper extremity and 15 cases the lower one). All patients underwent surgery. The final diagnosis was made by means of bacteriologic culture of surgical specimens and histopathologic analysis. We compared surgical pathology and preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT.


RESULTS
In the first case studied, the infection was most accurately localized with a SUV with a lower level of 2.00 and an upper of 8.00. Upon comparing the pathological findings and the 18F-FDG PET/CT, we set a SUV with a lower level of 2.00 and an upper level of 8.00. In thirteen cases, infection was detected with positive pathological findings. Preoperative 18F-FDG PET/CT showed high accumulation in these cases. In the remaining three cases, no infection was detected on either pathological findings nor 18F-FDG PET/CT findings.


CONCLUSIONS
The infection focus of osteomyelitis was accurately visualized by setting the SUV cut-off lower level to 2.00 and upper level to 8.00. We believe that this 18F-FDG PET/CT technique is helpful for image guided surgery of osteomyelitis.",Injury,32143858,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL

PDAC typically has a prominent stroma including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that express Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP). FAP is a new target molecule for PET imaging of various tumors. In this retrospective study we describe the clinical impact of PET/CT imaging using 68Ga-labelled FAP-Inhibitors (68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT) in 19 patients with PDAC (7 primary, 12 progressive/recurrent). Patients and Methods: All patients have undergone contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (ceCT) for TNM staging before they were subjected to 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT imaging. PET-scans were acquired 60 minutes after administration of 150-250 MBq of 68Ga-labelled FAP-specific tracers. In order to characterize 68Ga-FAPI-uptake over time, additional scans after 10 minutes and/or 180 minutes were performed in six patients. SUVmax and SUVmean values of PDAC manifestations and healthy organs were analyzed. The tumor burden according to 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT was compared to TNM staging based on ceCT and changes in oncological management were recorded. Results: Compared to ceCT, 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT results led to changes in TNM staging in 10/19 patients. 8/12 patients with recurrent/progressive disease, were up-staged, 1 down-staged and 3 had no change. In newly diagnosed PDAC, 1/7 patients was up-staged, the staging of 6 patients did not change. Changes in oncological management occurred in seven patients. Markedly elevated uptake of 68Ga-FAPI in PDAC manifestations after 1 hour was seen in most cases. Differentiation from pancreatitis based on static imaging 1 hour p.i. was challenging. With respect to imaging after multiple time points, PDAC and pancreatitis showed a trend for differential uptake kinetics. Conclusion: 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT led to restaging in half of patients with PDAC and most patients with recurrent disease compared to standard of care imaging. The clinical value of 68Ga-FAPI - PET/CT should be further investigated.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",33097632,68Ga-FAPI,"68Ga-labelled FAP-specific",NULL,NULL,CAFs

Preclinically, 18F-PI-2620 binds to both 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau isoforms. The purpose of this first-in-humans study was to evaluate the ability of 18F-PI-2620 to detect tau pathology in AD patients using PET imaging, as well as to assess the safety and tolerability of this new tau PET tracer. Methods: Participants with a clinical diagnosis of probable AD and healthy controls (HCs) underwent dynamic 18F-PI-2620 PET imaging for 180 min. 18F-PI-2620 binding was assessed visually and quantitatively using distribution volume ratios (DVR) estimated from noninvasive tracer kinetics and SUV ratio (SUVR) measured at different time points after injection, with the cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Time-activity curves and SUVR were assessed in AD and HC subjects, as well as DVR and SUVR correlations and effect size (Cohen's d) over time. Results: 18F-PI-2620 showed peak brain uptake around 5 min after injection and fast washout from nontarget regions. In AD subjects, focal asymmetric uptake was evident in temporal and parietal lobes, precuneus, and posterior cingulate cortex. DVR and SUVR in these regions were significantly higher in AD subjects than in HCs. Very low background signal was observed in HCs. 18F-PI-2620 administration was safe and well tolerated. SUVR time-activity curves in most regions and subjects achieved a secular equilibrium after 40 min after injection. A strong correlation (R 2 > 0.93) was found between noninvasive DVR and SUVR for all imaging windows starting at more than 30 min after injection. Similar effect sizes between AD and HC groups were obtained across the different imaging windows. 18F-PI-2620 uptake in neocortical regions significantly correlated with the degree of cognitive impairment. Conclusion: Initial clinical data obtained in AD and HC subjects demonstrated a high image quality and excellent signal-to-noise ratio of 18F-PI-2620 PET for imaging tau deposition in AD subjects. Noninvasive quantification using DVR and SUVR for 30-min imaging windows between 30 and 90 min after injection-for example, 45-75 min-provides robust and significant discrimination between AD and HC subjects. 18F-PI-2620 uptake in expected regions correlates strongly with neurocognitive performance.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",31712323,18F-PI-2620,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

To develop a technique to compare the intra-tumoral distribution of the drug gemcitabine, its surrogate [18F]-fluoroarabinocytosine ([18F]-FAC) and related chemotherapeutics 5-FU and capecitabine in a pre-clinical model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).


EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Using a KPC-organoid derived model of PDAC, we obtained autoradiographic images of the tumor distribution of, [14C]-gemcitabine, [14C]-5-FU, [3H]-capecitabine. These were compared indirectly by co-administering [18F]-FAC, a close analog of gemcitabine with a proven equivalent intra-tumor distribution. The short half-life of 18F allows for clean separation of 3H/14C labeled drugs in specimens by dual isotope digital autoradiography. Autoradiographic images of [14C]-gemcitabine, [3H]-capecitabine and [14C]-5-FU were each correlated to [18F]-FAC on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The tumor drug penetration was compared using cumulative histograms.


RESULTS
Gemcitabine distribution correlated strongly with FAC as expected. 5-FU also gave a similar microdistribution to that of FAC, whereas no correlation was found between capecitabine or its metabolic products and FAC distribution. Accumulation of Gemcitabine and 5-FU was lower in hypoxic regions of the tumor, whereas no such correlation was observed for capecitabine and its metabolites.


CONCLUSIONS
Gemcitabine and 5-FU target the same regions of the tumor, leaving hypoxic cells untreated. Capecitabine metabolites penetrate further into the tumor but it is yet to be determined whether these metabolites are the active form of the drug.","PloS one",32298392,[18F]-FAC,"3H/14C labeled drugs",NULL,NULL,NULL

The biodistribution of such 68Ga-labelled nanoparticles was followed in vivo in mice by positron emission tomography in combination with computer tomography (PET-CT). The biodistribution of 68Ga-labelled nanoparticles was compared for different application routes: intravenous, intramuscular, intratumoral, and into soft tissue. The particle distribution was measured in vivo by PET-CT after 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h, and ex vivo after 5 h. After intravenous injection (tail vein), the nanoparticles rapidly entered the lungs with later redistribution into liver and spleen. The nanoparticles remained mostly at the injection site following intramuscular, intratumoral, or soft tissue application, with less than 10 percent being mobilized into the blood stream. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The in vivo biodistribution of DOTA-terminated calcium phosphate nanoparticles was followed by PET/CT. To our knowledge, this is the first study of this kind. Four different application routes of clinical relevance were pursued: Intravascular, intramuscular, intratumoral, and into soft tissue. Given the high importance of calcium phosphate as biomaterial and for nanoparticular drug delivery and immunization, this is most important to assess the biofate of calcium phosphate nanoparticles for therapeutic application and also judge biodistribution of nanoscopic calcium phosphate ceramics, including debris from endoprostheses and related implants.","Acta biomaterialia",32251787,68Ga,"68Ga-labelled nanoparticles",PET-CT,NULL,NULL
52815,"Diagnostic and Clinical Impact of Staging 18F-FDG PET/CT in Mantle-Cell Lymphoma: A Two-Center Experience.","INTRODUCTION
The diagnostic accuracy of fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in staging mantle-cell lymphoma has not yet investigated. The aim of this 2-center retrospective study was to investigate the utility of 18F-FDG PET/CT in assessing nodal, splenic, bone marrow (BM), and gastrointestinal (GI) disease compared to CT, BM, and GI endoscopy; and to assess its clinical impact.


PATIENTS AND METHODS
One hundred twenty-two patients with histologically proven mantle-cell lymphoma were included. PET/CT BM findings were considered positive if isolated/multiple focal uptake in the BM not explained by benign findings and/or diffuse BM uptake higher than liver with/without focal uptakes were present. PET/CT findings were considered positive for GI involvement in the presence of isolated/multiple focal uptake in the GI organ.


RESULTS
All patients had positive PET/CT showing the presence of at least one hypermetabolic lesion, with the exception of one case. PET/CT results, compared to CT, detected more nodal and/or splenic lesions in 26 patients. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of PET/CT for BM were 52%, 98%, 97%, 65%, and 74%; for GI 64%, 91%, 69%, 90%, and 85%; and for GI excluding diabetic patients, 78%, 92%, 72%, 94%, and 89%. PET/CT permitted upstaging of 21 cases and downstaging of 2.


CONCLUSION
18F-FDG PET/CT showed excellent detection rate in nodal and splenic disease-a rate better than CT. For BM and GI evaluation, in order to reach good accuracy, the selection of patients and the use of specific criteria for evaluation of these organs seems to be crucial.

The AAZTA chelator and in particular its bifunctional derivative AAZTA5 was recently investigated to demonstrate unique capabilities to complex diagnostic and therapeutic trivalent radiometals under mild conditions. This study presents a comparison of 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu-labeled AAZTA5-PSMA-617 with DOTA-PSMA-617 analogues. We evaluated the radiolabeling characteristics, in vitro stability of the radiolabeled compounds and evaluated their binding affinity and internalization behavior on LNCaP tumor cells in direct comparison to the radiolabeled DOTA-conjugated PSMA-617 analogs.


RESULTS
AAZTA5 was synthesized in a five-step synthesis and coupled to the PSMA-617 backbone on solid phase. Radiochemical evaluation of AAZTA5-PSMA-617 with 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu achieved quantitative radiolabeling of > 99% after less than 5 min at room temperature. Stabilities against human serum, PBS buffer and EDTA and DTPA solutions were analyzed. While there was a small degradation of the 68Ga complex over 2 h in human serum, PBS and EDTA/DTPA, the 44Sc and 177Lu complexes were stable at 2 h and remained stable over 8 h and 1 day. For all three compounds, i.e. [natGa]Ga-AAZTA5-PSMA-617, [natSc]Sc-AAZTA5-PSMA-617 and [natLu]Lu-AAZTA5-PSMA-617, in vitro studies on PSMA-positive LNCaP cells were performed in direct comparison to radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 yielding the corresponding inhibition constants (Ki). Ki values were in the range of 8-31 nM values which correspond with those of [natGa]Ga-DOTA-PSMA-617, [natSc]Sc-DOTA-PSMA-617 and [natLu]Lu-DOTA-PSMA-617, i.e. 5-7 nM, respectively. Internalization studies demonstrated cellular membrane to internalization ratios for the radiolabeled 68Ga, 44Sc and 177Lu-AAZTA5-PSMA-617 tracers (13-20%IA/106 cells) in the same range as the ones of the three radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 tracers (17-20%IA/106 cells) in the same assay.


CONCLUSIONS
The AAZTA5-PSMA-617 structure proved fast and quantitative radiolabeling with all three radiometal complexes at room temperature, excellent stability with 44Sc, very high stability with 177Lu and medium stability with 68Ga in human serum, PBS and EDTA/DTPA solutions. All three AAZTA5-PSMA-617 tracers showed binding affinities and internalization ratios in LNCaP cells comparable with that of radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 analogues. Therefore, the exchange of the chelator DOTA with AAZTA5 within the PSMA-617 binding motif has no negative influence on in vitro LNCaP cell binding characteristics. In combination with the faster and milder radiolabeling features, AAZTA5-PSMA-617 thus demonstrates promising potential for in vivo application for theranostics of prostate cancer.","EJNMMI radiopharmacy and chemistry",33242189,68Ga,"radiolabeled DOTA-PSMA-617 analogues","radiometal complexes","PSMA-617 binding motif","LNCaP cells"
59275,"Evaluation of 18F-IAM6067 as a sigma-1 receptor PET tracer for neurodegeneration in vivo in rodents and in human tissue.","The sigma 1 receptor (S1R) is widely expressed in the CNS and is mainly located on the endoplasmic reticulum. The S1R is involved in the regulation of many neurotransmission systems and, indirectly, in neurodegenerative diseases. The S1R may therefore represent an interesting neuronal biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's (PD) or Alzheimer's diseases (AD). Here we present the characterisation of the S1R-specific 18F-labelled tracer 18F-IAM6067 in two animal models and in human brain tissue. Methods: Wistar rats were used for PET-CT imaging (60 min dynamic acquisition) and metabolite analysis (1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 60 min post-injection). To verify in vivo selectivity, haloperidol, BD1047 (S1R ligand), CM398 (S2R ligand) and SB206553 (5HT2B/C antagonist) were administrated for pre-saturation studies. Excitotoxic lesions induced by intra-striatal injection of AMPA were also imaged by 18F-IAM6067 PET-CT to test the sensitivity of the methods in a well-established model of neuronal loss. Tracer brain uptake was also verified by autoradiography in rats and in a mouse model of PD (intrastriatal 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) unilateral lesion). Finally, human cortical binding was investigated by autoradiography in three groups of subjects (control subjects with Braak ≤2, and AD patients, Braak >2 & ≤4 and Braak >4 stages). Results: We demonstrate that despite rapid peripheral metabolism of 18F-IAM6067, radiolabelled metabolites were hardly detected in brain samples. Brain uptake of 18F-IAM6067 showed differences in S1R anatomical distribution, namely from high to low uptake: pons-raphe, thalamus medio-dorsal, substantia nigra, hypothalamus, cerebellum, cortical areas and striatum. Pre-saturation studies showed 79-90% blockade of the binding in all areas of the brain indicated above except with the 5HT2B/C antagonist SB206553 and S2R ligand CM398 which induced no significant blockade, indicating good specificity of 18F-IAM6067 for S1Rs. No difference between ipsi- and contralateral sides of the brain in the mouse model of PD was detected. AMPA lesion induced a significant 69% decrease in 18F-IAM6067 uptake in the globus pallidus matching the neuronal loss as measured by NeuN, but only a trend to decrease (-16%) in the caudate putamen despite a significant 91% decrease in neuronal count. Moreover, no difference in the human cortical binding was shown between AD groups and controls. Conclusion: This work shows that 18F-IAM6067 is a specific and selective S1R radiotracer. The absence or small changes in S1R detected here in animal models and human tissue warrants further investigations and suggests that S1R might not be the anticipated ideal biomarker for neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and PD.",Theranostics,32724451,18F-IAM6067,"18F-labelled tracer 18F-IAM6067",S1R,NULL,NULL

Methods: Twenty-three patients underwent whole-body immuno-PET after injection of 150 MBq of 68Ga-IMP288, a histamine-succinyl-glycine peptide given after initial targeting of a trivalent anti-CEA, bispecific, antipeptide antibody. The gold standards were histology and imaging follow-up. Tumor SUVs (SUVmax and SUVmean) were measured, and tumor burden was analyzed using total tumor volume and total lesion activity. Results: The total lesion sensitivity of immuno-PET and 18F-FDG PET were 94.7% (1,116/1,178) and 89.6% (1,056/1,178), respectively. Immuno-PET had a somewhat higher sensitivity than CT or 18F-FDG PET in lymph nodes (92.4% vs. 69.7% and 89.4%, respectively) and liver metastases (97.3% vs. 92.1% and 94.8%, respectively), whereas sensitivity was lower for lung metastases (48.3% vs. 100% and 75.9%, respectively). Immuno-PET showed higher sensitivity than MRI or 18F-FDG PET for bone lesions (95.8% vs. 90.7% and 89.3%, respectively). In contrast to 18F-FDG PET, immuno-PET disclosed brain metastases. Despite equivalent tumor SUVmax, SUVmean, and total tumor volume, total lesion activity was significantly higher with immuno-PET than with 18F-FDG PET (P = 0.009). Conclusion: Immuno-PET using anti-CEA/anti-IMP288 bispecific antibody, followed by 68Ga-IMP288, is a potentially sensitive theranostic imaging method for HER2-negative, CEA-positive metastatic breast cancer patients and warrants further research.","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",32169921,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET","anti-CEA/anti-IMP288 bispecific antibody",NULL,"HER2-negative, CEA-positive metastatic breast cancer"
9952,"Evaluation of improved attenuation correction in whole-body PET/MR on patients with bone metastasis using various radiotracers.","PURPOSE
This study evaluates the quantitative effect of improved MR-based attenuation correction (AC), including bone segmentation and the HUGE method for truncation correction in PET/MR whole-body hybrid imaging specifically of oncologic patients with bone metastasis and using various radiotracers.


METHODS
Twenty-three patients that underwent altogether 28 whole-body PET/MR examinations with findings of bone metastasis were included in this study. Different radiotracers (18F-FDG, 68Ga-PSMA, 68Ga-DOTATOC, 124I-MIBG) were injected according to appropriate clinical indications. Each of the 28 whole-body PET datasets was reconstructed three times using AC with (1) standard four-compartment μ-maps (background air, lung, muscle, and soft tissue), (2) five-compartment μ-maps (adding bone), and (3) six-compartment μ-maps (adding bone and HUGE truncation correction). The SUVmax of each detected bone lesion was measured in each reconstruction to evaluate the quantitative impact of improved MR-based AC. Relative difference images between four- and six-compartment μ-maps were calculated. MR-based HUGE truncation correction was compared with the PET-based MLAA truncation correction method in all patients.


RESULTS
Overall, 69 bone lesions were detected and evaluated. The mean increase in relative difference over all 69 lesions in SUVmax was 5.4 ± 6.4% when comparing the improved six-compartment AC with the standard four-compartment AC. Maximal relative difference of 28.4% was measured in one lesion. Truncation correction with HUGE worked robust and resulted in realistic body contouring in all 28 exams and for all 4 different radiotracers. Truncation correction with MLAA revealed overestimations of arm tissue volume in all PET/MR exams with 18F-FDG radiotracer and failed in all other exams with radiotracers 68Ga-PSMA, 68Ga-DOTATOC, and 124I- MIBG due to limitations in body contour detection.


CONCLUSION
Improved MR-based AC, including bone segmentation and HUGE truncation correction in whole-body PET/MR on patients with bone lesions and using various radiotracers, is important to ensure best possible diagnostic image quality and accurate PET quantification. The HUGE method for truncation correction based on MR worked robust and results in realistic body contouring, independent of the radiotracers used.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32125487,68Ga-DOTATOC,"124I- MIBG",MR,MLAA,NULL

Methods: Participants in this retrospective case-control study underwent whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/CT-MR imaging. All PET scans were qualitatively and semiquantitatively analyzed using standardized uptake values (SUVs) normalized to liver uptake, i.e., we calculated the ratio (SUVr) between the minimum, maximum, and mean SUVs for different organs and tissues and the mean SUV for the liver. Disease activity scores were assessed using Pouchot's criteria. Results: Eighteen patients diagnosed with AOSD and 24 controls (non-AOSD patients diagnosed with solid tumors, excluding lymphomas) were considered. A total of 38 PET/MR and nine PET/CT scans were analyzed. AOSD patients had higher SUVr than controls. All SUVr differed significantly between the patient and control group for bone marrow, and for the spleen, the only difference lacking statistical significance concerned the ratio of the minimum SUV for spleen to the mean SUV for liver. Though limited in number, AOSD responders to therapy showed lower uptakes during the period monitored. No correlations were found between Pouchot's scores and SUVr. Conclusion: Our data revealed higher spleen and bone marrow 18F-FDG uptakes on PET/CT and PET/MR images in AOSD patients than in controls. Together with clinical examinations and laboratory data, PET/CT and PET/MR seemed more reliable than Pouchot's score in assessing disease activity.","Frontiers in medicine",33195296,18F-FDG,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)",PET/MR,NULL,NULL

METHODS
Alongside the assessment of grooming, we performed [11C]ABP688 μPET/CT imaging in wildtype (wt; n=10) and ko (n=11) mice both at 3 and 9 months. Using the simplified reference tissue method (SRTM), the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated representing the in vivo availability of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in the brain with the cerebellum as a reference region. Longitudinal voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was performed on BPND images. Results were verified using [11C]ABP688 ex vivo autoradiography, [3H]ABP688 in vitro autoradiography, and mGluR5 immunohistochemistry.


RESULTS
Cross-sectional comparisons revealed significantly increased grooming parameters in ko animals, at both time points. A significant longitudinal increase in % grooming duration (+268.25%; p<0.05) reflected aggravation of this behavior in ko mice. [11C]ABP688 μPET revealed significantly lower mGluR5 availability in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and amygdala of ko mice at both ages.

35585,"Synthesis and Preclinical Evaluation of a 68Ga-Radiolabeled Peptide Targeting Very Late Antigen-3 for PET Imaging of Pancreatic Cancer.","Pancreatic cancer is highly malignant and has a five-year survival rate of 5% due to an early lymph node, nerve, and vascular metastasis. Integrin α3β1 (also called very late antigen-3, VLA-3) is overexpressed in many tumors and plays a vital role in tumor formation, recurrence, and metastasis. In this study, we developed a 68Ga-radiolabeled peptide tracer targeting the α3 unit of VLA-3 and evaluated its potential application in positron emission computed tomography (PET) imaging of pancreatic cancer. NOTA-CK11 was prepared by solid-phase synthesis and successfully radiolabeled with 68Ga with greater than 99% radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 37 ± 5 MBq/nmol (n = 5). The expression level of integrin α3 in three human pancreatic cancer cells was evaluated with the order of SW1990, BXPC-3, and PANC-1 from high to low, while the expression level of integrin β1 was relatively close. When SW1990 cells with the highest expression level of VLA-3 were stained with FITC-CK11, strong fluorescence was observed by flow cytometry and under a laser confocal microscope. However, no significant fluorescence was observed in the blocking group when treated with excessive CK11. 68Ga-NOTA-CK11 showed significant radioactivity accumulation in SW1990 cells and was blocked by CK11 successfully. Subsequent small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution studies in mice bearing SW1990 xenografts confirmed its high tumor uptake with a good tumor-to-blood ratio and tumor-to-muscle ratio (2.45 ± 0.31 and 3.65 ± 0.33, respectively) at 1 h post injection of the probe. In summary, we successfully developed a peptide-based imaging agent, 68Ga-NOTA-CK11, that showed a strong binding affinity with VLA-3 and good target specificity for SW1990 cells and xenografted pancreatic tumor, rending it a promising radiotracer for PET imaging of VLA-3 expression in pancreatic cancer.","Molecular pharmaceutics",32544337,68Ga-NOTA-CK11,"68Ga-radiolabeled peptide tracer",VLA-3,NULL,"SW1990 cells"

Imaging probes/biomarkers that are correlated with molecular or microenvironmental alterations in tumors have been used not only in diagnosing cancer but also in assessing the efficacy of cancer treatment. We evaluated the early response of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to radiation treatment using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI, and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET).


METHODS
Orthotopic HCC tumors were established in the right liver lobe of Balb/c mice. Mice were longitudinally scanned using T2-weighted/DW MRI and 18F-FDG PET 1 day before and on days 1, 3, 6, 9 and 13 after irradiation with 15 Gy to the right liver lobe to determine tumor size, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value, and maximum standardized uptake value. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed to validate the tumor microenvironment.


RESULTS
Irradiation markedly retarded tumor growth in the orthotopic HCC model and led to increaes in ADC values as early as on day 1 after irradiation. Irradiation also resulted in increases in 18F-FDG uptake on day 1 that were sustained until the end of the observation period. IHC staining revealed a decrease in the number of proliferative cells and a continuous macrophage influx into irradiated tumors, which dramatically altered the tumor microenvironment. Lastly, in vitro coculture of HCC cells and macrophages led to interaction between the cells and enhanced the cellular uptake of 18F-FDG.


CONCLUSION
ADC values and 18F-FDG uptake measured using DW MRI and 18F-FDG PET serve as potential biomarkers for early assessment of HCC tumor responses to radiation therapy.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31127350,18F-FDG,18F-FDG.,ADC,"right liver lobe",NULL

67020,"The utility of 18F-FDG PET and PET/CT in the diagnosis and staging of chondrosarcoma: a meta-analysis.","OBJECTIVE
Chondrosarcoma is the second most common primary bone sarcoma; however, unlike other tumors, the biopsy cannot easily make a definite diagnosis or predict the histological grade. This meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the utility of 18F-FDG PET and PET/CT to differentiate chondrosarcoma from benign cartilaginous lesions and to predict the histopathological grade of chondrosarcoma.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
A comprehensive search was performed in three electronic databases including Medline/PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase to retrieve diagnostic studies evaluating the role of 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT for appraising the status of chondrosarcoma. Reference lists of related articles were also scrutinized manually. Useful data were extracted to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC), and the area under the curve (AUC) of 18F-FDG PET or PET/CT in diagnosing chondrosarcoma, and pooled weighted mean differences (WMD) of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) between different entities of cartilaginous neoplasms by using Stata 19.0.


RESULTS
A total of twelve studies provided sufficient data for the quantitative analysis. For the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and DOR of 18F-FDG PET were 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 0.97), 0.82 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.94), and 24.244 (95% CI 1.985 to 96.148), respectively while those of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 0.94 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.97), 0.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.93), and 112.999 (95% CI 41.341 to 308.866), respectively. The pooled WMD of SUVmax were - 0.89 (95% CI -1.67 to -0.10) between benign cartilaginous lesions and grade 1 (G1) chondrosarcoma, -1.94 (95% CI -2.76 to -1.12) between G1 and grade 2 (G2) chondrosarcoma, and - 2.37 (95% CI -5.79 to 1.05) between G2 and grade 3 (G3) chondrosarcoma.


CONCLUSIONS
In a word, 18F-FDG PET/CT revealed excellent accuracy in the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma and might assist in clinical decision-making. Meanwhile, although SUVmax alone showed restricted ability to differentiate benign cartilaginous lesions and G1 chondrosarcoma, as well as between G2 and G3 chondrosarcoma, it can identify intermediate/high-grade chondrosarcoma from low-grade ones.

To analyze the correlation between ultrasound breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category and fluorodeoxyglucose [18F] (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) findings and their value in breast lesion diagnosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cases involving hypermetabolic lesions identified by 18F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound were retrospectively analyzed. The correlation between the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the lesions and the BI-RADS grades was calculated. Histologic diagnosis or evidence at the end of a 2-year follow-up as the standard of truth were analyzed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of the diagnostic methods. Area under the curve (AUC) of BI-RADS, SUVmax, and BI-RADS/SUVmax combined were obtained using receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.


RESULTS
Of 206 cases, 92 were benign and 114 were malignant. The difference between the SUVmax and the BI-RADS grades was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The critical value of the optimal SUVmax was 2.325, and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 84.5%, 91.2%, 76.1%, 82.5%, and 87.5%, respectively. For diagnosis using BI-RADS, these values were 85.9%, 98.2%, 70.7%, 80.6%, and 97.0%, respectively. ROC analysis of 206 breast lesions for distinguishing benign from malignant lesions yielded AUCs of 0.948, 0.896, and 0.977 for BI-RADS, SUVmax, and BI-RADS/SUVmax combined, respectively. The critical value of the optimal SUVmax in grade 3 and 4 lesions (as determined using BI-RADS) was 2.705, and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 82.6%, 77.8%, 85.7%, 77.8%, and 85.7%, respectively. For diagnosis using BI-RADS in cases with grade 3 and 4 lesions, these values were 68.5%, 94.4%, 51.8%, 55.7%, and 93.5%, respectively. In ROC analysis for distinguishing benign from malignant for BI-RADS grade 3-4 lesions, the AUC of BI-RADS, SUVmax, and BI-RADS/SUVmax combined were 0.731, 0.859, and 0.882, respectively.


CONCLUSION
Both 18F-FDG PET/CT and ultrasound-dependent BI-RADS grading are effective for diagnosing breast lesions. However, in cases of BI-RADS grades 3 and 4, 18F-FDG PET/CT has better specificity and may be useful for further differential diagnosis.","Academic radiology",31311773,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL
31024,"Brown adipose tissue imaging using the TSPO tracer [18F]fluoromethyl-PBR28-d2: A comparison with [18F]FDG.","INTRODUCTION
Currently, the reference method of brown adipose tissue (BAT) imaging is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET). BAT imaging by [18F]FDG PET requires additional stimulation process, which is inconvenient and hard to be standardized. The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) PET has been found to be effective for visualization of BAT. Herein, we evaluated the feasibility of [18F]fluoromethyl-PBR28-d2 ([18F]fmPBR28-d2), a TSPO PET tracer, for interscapular BAT imaging in comparison with [18F]FDG PET.


METHODS
C57BL/6 mice were used for the [18F]fmPBR28-d2 and [18F]FDG PET imaging. [18F]fmPBR28-d2 PET was performed in the thermoneutral condition (n = 5) and after cold exposure (4 °C for 4 h) on the next day using the same mice. [18F]FDG PET was performed in the thermoneutral and cold exposure conditions with the same method with [18F]fmPBR28-d2 PET. Ex vivo biodistribution study of [18F]fmPBR28-d2 was performed in ten C57BL/6 mice (5: thermoneutral, 5: cold exposure). TSPO immunohistochemistry was done in interscapular BAT.


RESULTS
The [18F]fmPBR28-d2 PET images showed prominent interscapular BAT uptakes under both thermoneutral and cold exposure conditions. While, the BAT uptake was significantly higher under the cold exposure condition than the thermoneutral condition (12.83 ± 5.06 vs. 22.50 ± 6.03, P = 0.007). Also, [18F]FDG PET imaging showed higher BAT uptake under the cold exposure condition than thermoneutral condition (8.40 ± 0.63 vs. 21.41 ± 4.03, P = 0.001). The interscapular BAT to background (thigh muscle) ratio was higher in [18F]fmPBR28-d2 PET than [18F]FDG PET under both thermoneutral and cold exposure conditions. Ex vivo biodistribution study using [18F]fmPBR28-d2 also showed higher BAT uptake under cold exposure than the thermoneutral condition (8.86 ± 1.74 vs.16.93 ± 4.74, P = 0.036). Also, IHC demonstrated that TSPO expression was significantly increased in the cold exposure group.


CONCLUSIONS
[18F]FmPBR28-d2 PET demonstrated prominent interscapular BAT uptakes regardless of additional stimulation, and showed a higher BAT to background ratio than [18F]FDG PET. Also, we found that [18F]fmPBR28-d2 PET uptake and TSPO expression of BAT increased under cold exposure condition.

With the increase of especially hospital-acquired infections, timely and accurate diagnosis of bacterial infections is crucial for effective patient care. Molecular imaging has the potential for specific and sensitive detection of infections. Siderophores are iron-specific chelators recognized by specific bacterial transporters, representing one of few fundamental differences between bacterial and mammalian cells. Replacing iron by gallium-68 without loss of bioactivity is possible allowing molecular imaging by positron emission tomography (PET).

Specific uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B was tested in vitro in different microbial cultures. In vivo biodistribution was studied in healthy mice and dosimetric estimation for human setting performed. PET/CT imaging was carried out in animal infection models, representing the most common pathogens.


RESULTS
DFO-B was labelled with 68Ga with high radiochemical purity and displayed hydrophilic properties, low protein binding and high stability in human serum and PBS. The high in vitro uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B in selected strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus agalactiae could be blocked with an excess of iron-DFO-B. [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B showed rapid renal excretion and minimal retention in blood and other organs in healthy mice. Estimated human absorbed dose was 0.02 mSv/MBq. PET/CT images of animal infection models displayed high and specific accumulation of [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B in both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus infections with excellent image contrast. No uptake was found in sterile inflammation, heat-inactivated P. aeruginosa or S. aureus and Escherichia coli lacking DFO-B transporters.


CONCLUSION
DFO-B can be easily radiolabelled with 68Ga and displayed suitable in vitro characteristics and excellent pharmacokinetics in mice. The high and specific uptake of [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo, proving the potential of [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B for specific imaging of bacterial infections. As DFO-B is used in clinic for many years and the estimated radiation dose is lower than for other 68Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals, we believe that [68Ga]Ga-DFO-B has a great potential for clinical translation.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32734456,[68Ga]Ga-DFO-B,"68Ga-labelled radiopharmaceuticals",NULL,NULL,NULL

29517,"Delayed 18F-FDG PET/CT Appearance of Urachal Adenocarcinomas.","Background
Urachal carcinoma is a rare urological malignancy. Use of 18F-FDG PET/CT in urological oncology has developed slowly because of the urinary elimination of 18F-FDG. We investigated whether delayed postdiuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT could be used for diagnosing urachal carcinoma.


Methods
This retrospective study included 6 patients who underwent delayed postdiuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT for the evaluation of urachal carcinoma. The delayed postdiuretic PET/CT parameters and clinical characteristics of urachal carcinoma were investigated.


Results
There was no significant difference in the SUVmax between the primary tumors and the urine in the bladder before delayed diuresis (25.4 ± 19.5 vs. 42.9 ± 31.1, P=0.18). However, the SUVmax of the primary tumors was significantly higher than the SUVmax of urine after delayed diuresis (25.4 ± 19.5 vs. 3.5 ± 1.6, P=0.002). Diuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT was positive in all patients when compared with normal liver tissues or urine after delayed diuresis. The SUVmax, TLR, and TUR of the primary tumors were 25.4 (range: 7.2-58.9), 7.0 (range: 1.8-14.7), and 6.8 (range: 3.8-11.3), respectively. Delayed postdiuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT had a negative predictive value of 100% (5/5) for predicting lymph node metastasis. One patient received chemotherapy after radical resection of urachal carcinoma because 18F-FDG PET/CT found lung metastases, and one patient only received chemotherapy because PET/CT found peritoneal and skeletal metastases.


Conclusions
Delayed postdiuretic 18F-FDG PET/CT is a useful tool for the preoperative evaluation of urachal carcinoma. 18F-FDG PET/CT may improve clinical decision making and management of urachal carcinomas.","Contrast media & molecular imaging",33013244,18F-FDG,"18F-FDG PET/CT",NULL,NULL,NULL

Here, we evaluated very early changes of primary and secondary lymphoid organs under CIT in multiparametric [18F]-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET)/MRI as possible predictors of treatment response and investigated their correlation with baseline blood immune biomarkers. Between October 2014 and November 2017, 17 patients with unresectable melanoma (8 females; 65±11 years) undergoing CIT were prospectively evaluated using whole-body 18F-FDG-PET/MRI before CIT start (t0), 2 weeks (t1) and 3 months after CIT initiation (t2). At each time point, the volume, the 18F-FDG-uptake and the mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the spleen as well as the 18F-FDG uptake of the bone marrow were assessed. Relative lymphocyte count (RLC), relative eosinophil count (REC) and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were assessed at baseline. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours modified for immune-based therapeutics (iRECIST) and decisions from an interdisciplinary tumor board were used for treatment response evaluation at t2 iRECIST was compared with PET response criteria in solid tumors for image-based response evaluation at different time points. Comparative analysis was conducted with Mann-Whitney U test with false discovery rate correction for multiple testing and correlation coefficients were computed. In lymphoid organs, significant differences (p<0.05) between responders (9/17) and non-responders were found for the 18F-FDG-uptake in the spleen at t1 and the increase of the uptake t1-t0 (responders/non-responders: standardized uptake value lean body mass 1.19/0.93; +49%/-1%). The best correlation coefficients to baseline biomarkers were found for the 18F-FDG-uptake in the spleen at t1: NLR, r=-0.46; RLC, r=0.43; REC, r=0.58 (p<0.05), respectively. Compared with the non-responder group, the responder group showed marked increases also in the volume of the spleen (+22%/+10%), the 18F-FDG-uptake of bone marrow (+31%/-9%) at t1 and the ADCmean at t2 (+46%/+15%) compared with t0, however, not reaching significance. Our findings indicate that an effective systemic immune response in patients undergoing CIT can be detected as a significantly increased spleen activity in 18F-FDG-PET as early as 2 weeks after treatment initiation.

This three-step, two-pot, and two-step purification synthesis was done within 2 h. The use of tris[(1-hydroxypropyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine (THPTA) as a Cu(I) stabilizing agent increased the overall radiochemical yield by 4-fold (10 ± 2%, n = 13) compared to the reaction without THPTA (2.4 ± 0.2%, n = 3; decay-corrected from 18F produced at the end-of-beam).

To assess the benefits of coronary collateral circulation on myocardial perfusion, viability and function in patients with total occlusion of a single coronary artery using the 99mTc-sestamibi SPECT and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET.


METHODS
164 Consecutive patients were included who underwent coronary angiography results exhibited total occlusion of a single coronary artery and received 99mTc-MIBI SPECT and 18F-FDG PET within 90 days of angiography. Myocardial perfusion and viability in patients with collateral circulation and those without it were compared. Long-term follow-up was performed through a review of patient clinical records.


RESULTS
Collateral circulation was present in 56 patients (34%) and absent in 108 patients (66%). The total perfusion defect size in patients with collateral circulation decreased when compared to those without (30% ± 13% to 35% ± 14%, P < .05). The myocardial viability was 22% ± 12% in patients with collateral circulation, and 12% ± 9% in those without (P < .001). The left ventricular ejection fraction was higher, and the end-diastolic and end-systolic left ventricular volumes were lower in patients with collateral circulation (39% ± 11%, 138 ± 66, 89 ± 57) compared to patients without collateral circulation (31% ± 9%, 177 ± 55, 125 ± 48, all P < .001, respectively).

The objectives of the present work were to optimize and validate the synthesis and stability of 14(R,S)-[18F]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid ([18F]FTHA) and 16-[18F]fluoro-4-thia-palmitic acid ([18F]FTP) under cGMP conditions for clinical applications.


METHODS
Benzyl-14-(R,S)-tosyloxy-6-thiaheptadecanoate and methyl 16-bromo-4-thia-palmitate were used as precursors for the synthesis of [18F]FTHA and [18F]FTP, respectively. For comparison, a fatty acid analog lacking a thia-substitution, 16-[18F]fluoro-palmitic acid ([18F]FP), was synthesized from the precursor methyl 16-bromo-palmitate. A standard nucleophilic reaction using cryptand (Kryptofix/K222, 8.1 mg), potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 4.0 mg) and 18F-fluoride were employed for the 18F-labeling and potassium hydroxide (0.8 M) was used for the post-labeling ester hydrolysis. The final products were purified via reverse phase semi-preparative HPLC and concentrated via trap and release on a C-18 plus solid phase extraction cartridge. The radiochemical purities of the [18F]fluorothia fatty acids and [18F]FP were examined over a period of 4 h post-synthesis using an analytical HPLC. All the syntheses were optimized in an automated TRACERlab FX-N Pro synthesizer. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) and high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was employed to study the identity and nature of side products formed during radiosynthesis and as a consequence of post-synthesis radiation induced oxidation.


RESULTS
Radiosyntheses of [18F]FTHA, [18F]FTP and [18F]FP were achieved in moderate (8-20% uncorrected) yields. However, it was observed that the HPLC-purified [18F]fluorothia fatty acids, [18F]FTHA and [18F]FTP at higher radioactivity concentrations (>1.11 GBq/mL, 30 mCi/mL) underwent formation of 18F-labeled side products over time but [18F]FP (lacking a sulfur heteroatom) remained stable up to 4 h post-synthesis. Various radiation protectors like ethanol and ascorbic acid were examined to minimize the formation of side products formed during [18F]FTHA and [18F]FTP synthesis but showed only limited to no effect. Analysis of the side products by LCMS showed formation of sulfoxides of both [18F]FTHA and [18F]FTP. The identity of the sulfoxide side product was further confirmed by synthesizing a non-radioactive reference standard of the sulfoxide analog of FTP and matching retention times on HPLC and molecular ion peaks on LC/HRMS. Radiation-induced oxidation of the sulfur heteroatom was mitigated by dilution of product with isotonic saline to reduce the radioactivity concentration to <0.518 GBq/mL (14 mCi/mL).


CONCLUSIONS
Successful automated synthesis of [18F]fluorothia fatty acids were carried out in cGMP facility for their routine production and clinical applications. Instability of [18F]fluorothia fatty acids were observed at radioactivity concentrations exceeding 1.11 GBq/mL (30 mCi/mL) but mitigated through dilution of the product to <0.518 GBq/mL (14 mCi/mL). The identities of the side products formed were established as the sulfoxides of the respective thia fatty acids caused by radiation-induced oxidation of the sulfur heteroatom.","Nuclear medicine and biology",31759313,[18F]FTP,"[18F]fluorothia fatty acids",NULL,NULL,NULL

The co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 are upregulated on activated antigen-presenting cells (APC). We investigated whether local APC activation, induced by subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), can be imaged by positron emission tomography (PET) with CD80/CD86-targeting 64Cu-labelled abatacept.


PROCEDURES
Mice were inoculated s.c. with extracellular-matrix gel containing either LPS or vehicle (PBS). Immune cell populations were analysed by flow cytometry and marker expression by RT-qPCR. 64Cu-NODAGA-abatacept distribution was analysed using PET/CT and ex vivo biodistribution.


RESULTS
The number of CD80+ and CD86+ immune cells at the LPS inoculation site significantly increased a few days after inoculation. CD68 and CD86 expression were higher at the LPS than the PBS inoculation site, and CD80 was only increased at the LPS inoculation site. CTLA-4 was highest 10 days after LPS inoculation, when CD80/CD86 decreased again. A few days after inoculation, 64Cu-NODAGA-abatacept distribution to the inoculation site was significantly higher for LPS than PBS (4.2-fold).

This study proposes optimal tracer-specific threshold-based window levels for PSMA PET-based intraprostatic gross tumour volume (GTV) contouring to reduce interobserver delineation variability.


METHODS
Nine 68Ga-PSMA-11 and nine 18F-PSMA-1007 PET scans including GTV delineations of four expert teams (GTVmanual) and a majority-voted GTV (GTVmajority) were assessed with respect to a registered histopathological GTV (GTVhisto) as the gold standard reference. The standard uptake values (SUVs) per voxel were converted to a percentage (SUV%) relative to the SUVmax. The statistically optimised SUV% threshold (SOST) was defined as those that maximises accuracy for threshold-based contouring. A leave-one-out cross-validation receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the SOST for each tracer. The SOST analysis was performed twice, first using the GTVhisto contour as training structure (GTVSOST-H) and second using the GTVmajority contour as training structure (GTVSOST-MA) to correct for any limited misregistration. The accuracy of both GTVSOST-H and GTVSOST-MA was calculated relative to GTVhisto in the 'leave-one-out' patient of each fold and compared with the accuracy of GTVmanual.


RESULTS
ROC curve analysis for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET revealed a median threshold of 25 SUV% (range, 22-27 SUV%) and 41 SUV% (40-43 SUV%) for GTVSOST-H and GTVSOST-MA, respectively. For 18F-PSMA-1007 PET, a median threshold of 42 SUV% (39-45 SUV%) for GTVSOST-H and 44 SUV% (42-45 SUV%) for GTVSOST-MA was found. A significant pairwise difference was observed when comparing the accuracy of the GTVSOST-H contours with the median accuracy of the GTVmanual contours (median, - 2.5%; IQR, - 26.5-0.2%; p = 0.020), whereas no significant pairwise difference was found for the GTVSOST-MA contours (median, - 0.3%; IQR, - 4.4-0.6%; p = 0.199).


CONCLUSIONS
Threshold-based contouring using GTVmajority-trained SOSTs achieves an accuracy comparable with manual contours in delineating GTVhisto. The median SOSTs of 41 SUV% for 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET and 44 SUV% for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET form a base for tracer-specific window levelling.

We evaluated the potential usefulness of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the diagnosis of primary and metastatic lesions in various types of cancer, compared with [18F] FDG PET/CT.


METHODS
A total of 75 patients with various types of cancer underwent contemporaneous [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 and [18F] FDG PET/CT either for an initial assessment or for recurrence detection. Tumour uptake was quantified by the maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax).

RESULTS
The study cohort consisted of 75 patients (47 males and 28 females; median age, 61.5 years; age range, 32-85 years). Fifty-four patients with 12 different tumour entities underwent paired [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 and [18F] FDG PET/CT for initial assessment, while the other 21 patients underwent paired scans for recurrence detection. [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT was able to clearly identify 12 types of malignant tumours with favourable tumour-to-background contrast, which resulted in a higher detection rate of primary tumours than did [18F] FDG PET/CT (98.2% vs. 82.1%, P = 0.021).

The rapid degradation of PTAs may address safety concerns but usually limits the photothermal stability required for efficacious treatment. Conversely, PTAs with high photothermal stability usually degrade slowly. The solutions that address the balance between the high photothermal stability and rapid degradation of PTAs are rare. Here, we report that the inherent Cu2+-capturing ability of black phosphorus (BP) can accelerate the degradation of BP, while also enhancing photothermal stability. The incorporation of Cu2+ into BP@Cu nanostructures further enables chemodynamic therapy (CDT)-enhanced PTT. Moreover, by employing 64Cu2+, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can be achieved for in vivo real-time and quantitative tracking. Therefore, our study not only introduces an "ideal" PTA that bypasses the limitations of PTAs, but also provides the proof-of-concept application of BP-based materials in PET-guided, CDT-enhanced combination cancer therapy.","Nature communications",32513979,64Cu2,"(CDT)-enhanced PTT",NULL,NULL,NULL
22056,"TSPO PET detects acute neuroinflammation but not diffuse chronically activated MHCII microglia in the rat.","BACKGROUND
Accurate and sensitive imaging biomarkers are required to study the progression of white matter (WM) inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. Radioligands targeting the translocator protein (TSPO) are considered sensitive indicators of neuroinflammation, but it is not clear how well the expression of TSPO coincides with major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) molecules in WM. This study aimed to test the ability of TSPO to detect activated WM microglia that are immunohistochemically positive for MHCII in rat models of prodromal Alzheimer's disease and acute subcortical stroke.


METHODS
Fischer 344 wild-type (n = 12) and TgAPP21 (n = 11) rats were imaged with [18F]FEPPA PET and MRI to investigate TSPO tracer uptake in the corpus callosum, a WM region known to have high levels of MHCII activated microglia in TgAPP21 rats. Wild-type rats subsequently received an endothelin-1 (ET1) subcortical stroke and were imaged at days 7 and 28 post-stroke before immunohistochemistry of TSPO, GFAP, iNOS, and the MHCII rat antigen, OX6.


RESULTS
[18F]FEPPA PET was not significantly affected by genotype in WM and only detected increases near the ET1 infarct (P = 0.033, infarct/cerebellum uptake ratio: baseline = 0.94 ± 0.16; day 7 = 2.10 ± 0.78; day 28 = 1.77 ± 0.35). Immunohistochemistry confirmed that only the infarct (TSPO cells/mm2: day 7 = 555 ± 181; day 28 = 307 ± 153) and WM that is proximal to the infarct had TSPO expression (TSPO cells/mm2: day 7 = 113 ± 93; day 28 = 5 ± 7). TSPO and iNOS were not able to detect the chronic WM microglial activation that was detected with MHCII in the contralateral corpus callosum (day 28 OX6% area: saline = 0.62 ± 0.38; stroke = 4.30 ± 2.83; P = .029).


CONCLUSION
TSPO was only expressed in the stroke-induced insult and proximal tissue and therefore was unable to detect remote and non-insult-related chronically activated microglia overexpressing MHCII in WM. This suggests that research in neuroinflammation, particularly in the WM, would benefit from MHCII-sensitive radiotracers.","EJNMMI research",32990808,[18F]FEPPA,NULL,OX6,NULL,NULL
23736,"In vivo characterization of [18F]AVT-011 as a radiotracer for PET imaging of multidrug resistance.","PURPOSE
Multidrug resistance (MDR) impedes cancer treatment. Two efflux transporters from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family, ABCB1 and ABCG2, may contribute to MDR by restricting the entry of therapeutic drugs into tumor cells. Although a higher expression of these transporters has been correlated with an unfavorable response to chemotherapy, transporter expression does not necessarily correlate with function. In this study, we characterized the pharmacological properties of [18F]AVT-011, a new PET radiotracer for imaging transporter-mediated MDR in tumors.


METHODS
AVT-011 was radiolabeled with 18F and evaluated with PET imaging in preclinical models. Transport of [18F]AVT-011 by ABCB1 and/or ABCG2 was assessed by measuring its uptake in the brains of wild-type, Abcb1a/b-/-, and Abcg2-/- mice at baseline and after administration of the ABCB1 inhibitor tariquidar (n = 5/group). Metabolism and biodistribution of [18F]AVT-011 were also measured. To measure ABCB1 function in tumors, we performed PET experiments using both [18F]AVT-011 and [18F]FDG in mice bearing orthotopic breast tumors (n = 7-10/group) expressing clinically relevant levels of ABCB1.


RESULTS
At baseline, brain uptake was highest in Abcb1a/b-/- mice. After tariquidar administration, brain uptake increased 3-fold and 8-fold in wild-type and Abcg2-/- mice, respectively, but did not increase further in Abcb1a/b-/- mice. At 30 min after injection, the radiotracer was > 90% in its parent form and had highest uptake in organs of the hepatobiliary system. Compared with that in drug-sensitive tumors, uptake of [18F]AVT-011 was 32% lower in doxorubicin-resistant tumors with highest ABCB1 expression and increased by 40% with tariquidar administration. Tumor uptake of [18F]FDG did not significantly differ among groups.


CONCLUSION
[18F]AVT-011 is a dual ABCB1/ABCG2 substrate radiotracer that can quantify transporter function at the blood-brain barrier and in ABCB1-expressing tumors, making it potentially suitable for clinical imaging of ABCB1-mediated MDR in tumors.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",31729540,[18F]AVT-011,"ABCB1/ABCG2 substrate radiotracer",ABCG2,NULL,NULL
67298,"Tau PET imaging with 18F-PI-2620 in aging and neurodegenerative diseases.","PURPOSE
In vivo measurement of the spatial distribution of neurofibrillary tangle pathology is critical for early diagnosis and disease monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD).


METHODS
Forty-nine participants were scanned with 18F-PI-2620 PET to examine the distribution of this novel PET ligand throughout the course of AD: 36 older healthy controls (HC) (age range 61 to 86), 11 beta-amyloid+ (Aβ+) participants with cognitive impairment (CI; clinical diagnosis of either mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia, age range 57 to 86), and 2 participants with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA, age 66 and 78). Group differences in brain regions relevant in AD (medial temporal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex, and lateral parietal cortex) were examined using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) normalized to the inferior gray matter of the cerebellum.


RESULTS
SUVRs in target regions were relatively stable 60 to 90 min post-injection, with the exception of very high binders who continued to show increases over time. Robust elevations in 18F-PI-2620 were observed between HC and Aβ+ CI across all AD regions. Within the HC group, older age was associated with subtle elevations in target regions. Mildly elevated focal uptake was observed in the anterior temporal pole in one svPPA patient.


CONCLUSION
Preliminary results suggest strong differences in the medial temporal lobe and cortical regions known to be impacted in AD using 18F-PI-2620 in patients along the AD trajectory. This work confirms that 18F-PI-2620 holds promise as a tool to visualize tau aggregations in AD.","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging",32572562,18F-PI-2620,NULL,NULL,"medial temporal lobe",NULL
